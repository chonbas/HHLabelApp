"There is a law called something like the fair use law. Which allows the use of copyrighted material if it's for review, parody, critique, etc. By remixing a song, they are essentially protected by fair use. However, it is possible that the artist or their record company might contract them for royalties for their work. It's also possible that the DJ directly asks the company or artist for permission to use their content. which they could agree to for free, for royalties, or for a one time fee. "

"Honestly though, I've only ever met one player who have actually *used* his mic properly since I got my PS4 half a year ago. Everyone else has been:

1. Speaking a foreign language
2. Doing nothing but coughing and clearing his throat
3. Not talking, but making sure his mic picks up background noises such as fans, children, music or even the game itself
4. Having the mic too near or far away from the mouth, thus making it impossible to hear what he's saying

The games I play rarely require teamwork, which in my opinion is the only time I feel like I'd want to communicate via voice."

"Well bless your heart, then. Though I'm sure it was far more frustrating for the 200 or so years when the people of Georgia had butter all day long but not single electronic way to help them cool it off. The butter also might have had tuberculosis in it for most of that time. When I lived in Georgia we left the butter out on the counter; admittedly, we had A/C and were living high cotton. 

The butter bell cools a bit through evaporation, which is why it's better than nothing, but nothing should work for long enough to go through a stick of butter. Salt was originally added as a preservative for just this reason, along with enhancing flavor. "

"I tend to agree, although his potential is somewhat hidden in his seemingly conservative racing style. I think he's more of a Vettel style where he needs a specific set up or car attitude in order to really dominate and he hasn't gotten it from Grove yet. 

It could be the case that once he does jump ship to a team with a lot more funds and the right talent, for him, that he'll make a big impact. But that's just theory of course.

Ric seems like such a shoe-in at Ferrari - Italian heritage, obvious talent and drive. Only Vettel would be in the way it seems. I remember last year him playing down the whole ""all drivers want to drive for the Scuderia,"" idea, which could come back to bite him.

"So stupid. The only reason fat boy isn't dead, is because little man didn't have a clue what he was doing. He should've just picked up a chair and smashed it on fatties head and/or just kicked him in the balls mercilessly, or used some real ground n' pound techniques. Instead, he tried to get his Ultimate Fighter on and got suplexed instead. Of course, if either of them had any nuts big man could've thrown one punch and been done with it. Ironically, the little guy probably would've been better off in the long run too. 

BTW, why the fuck was fattie on the floor to begin with? Unless someone forcibly put him there, he was already off to a bad/dumb start.

"And you can't even recognize the independence of these nations by acknowledging Russia has no right, morally, legally or rationally, to object to nations requesting NATO membership? NATO doesn't move to encroach, NATO is asked what it would take to join them, and then countries fulfill certain requirements, because they want into a defensive alliance. There is no encroachment. No part of Russia is being asked into NATO. Russia has no authority over its neighbors. The sphere of influence argument is not only irrelevant, but it highlights Russia's history of bullying (that makes NATO so popular for the nations near them) as well as the current irrelevance of the Russian state. It's sphere of influence isn't being encroached upon, it's falling apart because Russia no longer has the military power to enforce it. "

I argued against the case presented which you seem to have a hard time following. Neither Christianity or whites are the reason for people's current attitude. Homosexuality is not favored in most of humanity's history. Picking out random examples on a continent as large as that to draw such a conclusion that blankets the continent and revisits history is laughable at best.

"Nuance isn't a problem... It's only a problem if you fail to even attempt to explain it and leave everything to assumptions.

""I believe in human rights"" is one statement, there are many who would contest that. There can be two people who believe in human rights, but have entirely different interpretations of them. There can be two people who phrase their beliefs differently and yet agree on many points.

Of course it's complicated, which is why when you make an argument you need to afford someone the time to question it and understand it better. 

Yet it seems here we keep working under assumptions of each other and don't really answer each other's questions to better understand. Then apparently it's considered good form to give snarky responses, completely miss the mark, and act as if you're too good to even give the other person a chance..."

"I actually asked you what your point was, cause I didn't see it. I think the way you started your statement was a giveaway of what you actually think. That this is a muslim thing. And I didn't accuse you of saying all muslims are like this. I simply stated why you didn't make a point in my eyes. I also stated that you and I both know that those billion people aren't all rapists. So no, there was no such accusation. 

I still don't think it's a muslim or islam problem. It's a problem of sick men. I know about the rich Saudi's and the way they treat girls (especially girls from my country). I hate them for it. I'm sure they will burn in hell for it. So yes, I'm still staying with my opinion that it's not a muslim problem but a problem of twisted men. 

You and I have very different sources about what Mohammed did, I guess. So I also have to disagree with you there. And you can say now that I'm blinded by faith and that I don't want to believe the truth. But the truth is whatever source we have we can never be 100% sure of who's right about him. I've simply read/heard both sides and chose one, as did you. I don't think we would ever agree on this, so I will not try to convince you and you shouldn't bother trying to convince me. 

Going back to the topic: I still don't see your point. This human trafficing thing happens all around the world. It's terrible, despicable and inhumane, but it's not a muslim thing.

large group fights are very unbalanced, im more useful on my 1500 rated boomkin than on my 2,2k rogue in a group fight.  And they are not fun ( this point is arguable), the most useful way too fight is simply tab targeting and spamming dots. 

av map is unbalanced, look at the stats even when the horde dominated all bg in the past, the alliance was still winning  most av games (maps should be fair in pvp)

pve encounters in a bg : i personally don't like having to fight a pve mob in a bg and a lot of players don't either , but i guess this point is arguable also ( maybe some people prefer that, but this was a very major point on why ashran is hated ( forcing pvpers to pve))

"Also, a simple pictures storage is way easier to implement than a replay system. To have a photo system working perfectly you only need to store it, have a simple viewer so people can see it and a basic tag system/album or whatever, this stuff has been done a thousand times and is really easy to do. 

A full replay system has to, for each game, record 10x the game live (there are multiple ways of doing it, all with pros and cons, you have to choose the best one for your game), when it's recorded, you have to store it (also 10 times), then you have to build a viewer which can be quite hard depending on how you choose to record games (SC2 records every move you make in the game and then play the game for you again when you wanna see it, cool system allowing for really small files, basically text files with commands in it). 

Okay, so now you have to multiply the number of games in a year (let's say replays are kept in storage for 1 year) by 10 and also take into account bandwidth because everytime someone wanna watch his replays he has to take it from the storage and download it.  

Easy uh."

"I'm going to be honest with you, yes there are atheists who are just assholes, but Reddit as a whole just doesn't seem to get it.

Granted it runs all the way from people being raped and murdered to disliking vocal prayer in organized government meetings. 

The fact is for as much as I hear about how awful atheists are on Reddit I almost never see it. The only thing I ever see are the ridiculous ""le edgy"" and ""euphoric"" memes that make the poster look like they're still in elementary school.

"I am finding out that the general perception of the state of things regarding police behavior and the reality are far from being the same. I'd not be surprised if the opinion of cop haters/apologists alike on down to the average 25 y/o woman without an opinion on the subject were unable to give an accurate account of the state of police behavior . People are fed lies and feel the need to 1) hate cops without the ability to forgive or 2) love them and feel that the worst cop abuse is justified due to it ""being a hard job"", putting their life on the line to PROTECT US etc. The truth is not within reach of the vast majority of news channel viewers. I'd say that based on what we're told through news agencies, we're fully incapable of forming a realistic opinion. Therefore, it's pointless and possibly even harmful to share opinions with the intention of showing other's they're wrong and why you're right. "
Apparently people do not understand hyperbole.
"He disappeared in game 6 of the Clippers series so badly that he didn't even play in the fourth quarter. There's plenty of times he's played very poorly under pressure. In the finals back with OKC, the first three games of last season's Portland series, game 5 of this series. He and Howard both have a habit of disappearing at key moments - they're inconsistent. LeBron or Chris Paul would never have a game where they turn the ball over 13 times, or shoot 2 for 11, or accrue 6 fouls in 10 minutes, or get a technical despite the threat of being suspended for a crucial playoff game. They aren't superstars like Morey likes to tout. They're both second or third options on a championship team.

We have the assets and cap space to sign and trade for that third star. But nope, Harden has to be the focal point of the offense, even though his own offense (and defense) are at times nonexistent. Face the truth, he's too inconsistent to be a Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant."

"You're thinking a little too dichotomously here. Feminism is specifically for women, it is motivated by a drive to liberate women from specific injustices faced uniquely by women, but the underlying causes of those injustices cause problems for other people too.

So let's get specific: do you mean misogyny in *intent*, or misogyny in *effect*? Because I think there's lots of anti-feminist rhetoric and behaviour perpetuated by people who don't, in their hearts or minds, oppose women's liberation, but it's nonetheless possible that their opposition has the real-world result of prolonging the aforementioned injustices. If they disagree in definition on what equality looks like, or if they disagree in practice on what measures will bring it about, then it might be more reasonable for feminists to regard these people as ""misguided allies"" rather than ""opponents"", but the line between those two categories can be blurry."

&gt;Under the laws of war, ""....it is especially forbidden....to declare that no quarter will be given"". This was established under Article 23 (d) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land.[2]
&gt;
Since a judgment on the law relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials in October 1946, the 1907 Hague Convention, including the explicit prohibition to declare that no quarter will be given, are considered to be part of the customary laws of war and are binding on all parties in an international armed conflict.[3]

You could have given him shit for so many things and have a laugh about it. You could have interveined and tell him to get his shit together if he wants to lead an adult relationship.

You chose the easy path, to kick him out and drop him like a hot potatoe. You strong and independet woman you. Here have a cookie.  

YOU did not get stronger, you just kicked a guy out that wanted to get straight with you.  If someone got stronger and learned a life lesson than it was him. I am just not sure if it is ""never trust a woman again"" or ""I need to get my shit together"" I don't know.

"&gt;Look at the NIST Report on WHY the building allegedly collapsed - NOT due to structural damage from being struck by debris, but from A SINGLE COLUMN being pushed off of its footing due to the expansion of LATERAL BEAMS that were heated by FIRES.

&gt;Assuming (in some fantasy world) that NIST's assessment was correct (it wasn't), who on the ground, that day could have possibly predicted that fanciful series of events - and how could they have made such a prediction?

The building had been on fire all day and the rescue operation had  been nixed. Two nearby  buildings had collapsed completely and a handful others destroyed catastrophically. 

&gt;Did firemen or engineers prowling about the building say ""hey, look, the fire is causing that lateral beam to expand - it's gonna' push that column off its footing, and, that is gonna' make the WHOLE BUILDING collapse - to the ground - in its own footprint"" ???

"HD televisions have higher input lag than CRTs. That's what he's getting at. It doesn't matter if Dolphin natively supports the Gamecube adapter and therefore can receive input near instantly (it's actually dependent on your processor speed, so it's effectively instant but it does contribute to delay) when your TV doesn't output what is going on to the screen until some delay time has been reached. 

There's nothing for him to ""get over"" because you are objectively wrong. CRTs wouldn't be the competitive standard if they could have comparably lag-free setups with HD televisions. Only expensive performance monitors can give a refresh rate comparable to CRTs, and I'm not even including the delay that's added from converting component signal to HDMI so it's more than just that.

"&gt;Unions are a solution looking for a problem.

Your comment is staggeringly ignorant. So staggeringly ignorant you should feel physical pain at how ill informed it is. 

There are real discussions to be had about the current state of unions, corruption within large union organizations, and such matters... but to say that unions are a solution looking for a problem so exceeds the definition of incorrect that it crash lands directly into ignorant.

"&gt;far, far more 

less?

&gt;There is no demand for holes dug, then filled back in. So your $30k investment in hole digging would result in a massive loss for you, and virtually no gain to the economy. The same way if you dumped $30k on the street and let people have it for free. 

30k spent in bags is the same though. The resale value of handbags is maybe 15% out of the shop floor and rapidly approaches 0 after a few years. Useless hole digging is 0 immediately so it is indeed slightly worse.

Yes, due to the supply side of things, that 30k of bags would have a sliiightly better economic impact than hole digging in some given timeframe (most likely). But many activities would do far better. Buses were an easy lazy example. But really, almost anything that provides a function after purchase to encourage or support economic activity will beat out handbags.

If you sell a power drill, that money spent goes on to the economy via all the people involved in making/getting you the drill. But the drill itself goes on to do some work or support in some economic activity. Both sides of the exchange are productive."

"The definition is really only used to express that white-males or other racial majorities are the primary group to benefit from racism.  I don't think there is anything anti-white about that, it is just reality in the west.  It is a poor use of terms, but I don't think it has some insidious nature behind it.  Also, by that definition it would still mean the Japanese were being racist, it is just about those with power over those without power in any given racial situation.

If you really think that a substantial amount of people that are devoting their life to equal rights and inclusion are anti-white then I think you are buying into some serious tea-bagger talking points.  There will always be a few tools in the world like in this article, but most people working towards equal rights and human right just want exactly that, equal.  Equal does not mean anti-white, it just means equal.  Unfortunately no one is equal anywhere in the world, so people invent terms to attempt to describe that, sometimes the terms they invent or change confuse the matter.  This is one of those cases."

"This is probably an unpopular opinion by me and it's just something I see when playing with female friends way more than with male. I don't know if there's any actual basis behind it. Women are much more emotional thinkers. Because of this, they are more likely to have emotional reactions in game. What I mean by this is if you take a hypothetical situation of a laner all-inning their lane opponent and losing, a female is more likely to have a reaction more along the lines of ""I need to fight him again, because they beat me. Maybe I just mis-played I can do it this time."" rather than ""I should just play safe and farm because they are now ahead"". As you might guess, a logical thought process is much more favored in a game like this.


Also men generally have faster reaction times but its such a small difference I can't see it being relevant."

"He sat up in bed, deciding to take on the challenge of seducing you with his words.  Alas his mind was to taken up with the things he should be doing instead of sitting online looking for new friends.  Its always been like that with him, focusing more on activities rather then maintaining the proper social capital to stave off his chronic depression.

&amp;nbsp;
But this was not wasted.  The delving into his mind allowed him to think about writing his novel.  Sure it was currently a piece of crap, and probably will remain a piece of crap, but the fact he was doing it was an improvement in most activities that he has chosen to take on.  He chuckled to himself.  ""Meaning of life, isn't it?"" he thought, ""always trying to improve yourself to be the person you wish to be.  Live life to your values.  Best way to be happy.""  A smile grew upon the face, reminding him that he needs to shave.
He thinks what there is to do today.  Its a small town.  Only moved there because of work.  Its an easy job with great pay.  Can't really complain, but then again he could if he really wanted to.  Life is so much better if you don't look for things to complain about.  ""Once I graduate from school online I will be able to move back to a city."" he thinks.  That is, if he gets back into school.  The cost of being an arrogant youth was one he was still paying.  It doesn't matter.  What he had learned from that time is almost worth the price he paid.
He thinks back over what he has written.  Shouldn't he do the normal a/s/l?  26, male, Minnesota?  But would that really matter?  This is the age of the internet, where people can be social to strangers across the world.  But if that is the case, why does he feel so lonely?  Should he talk about how he is funny?  Because while he is funny, isn't that what most women look for in people that they talk to?  A sigh escapes from his nostrils.  Perhaps after finishing this he will go look for someone to discuss philosophy with or really anything that creates a decisive topic.  He loves debating.  Not arguing, that is stressful and not fun.  But debating, trying to get into another's head to see where they are coming from and how it influenced their decisions and taking that, that life and incorporating it into how he views the world.  He can't describe it other than that it is incredibly satisfying, as if he is slowly understanding others.

&amp;nbsp;
He awaits, slightly discouraged.  He hopes that his response will get another and perhaps he will find a new friend.  But then again, this is the internet.  He's been rejected a lot by the silence his whirling computer fan gives him.  What would be one more?  Why should he risk the pain and again?  ""Because,"" his mind informs him, ""anything worth doing takes risk.""  The thought comforts him a little as he hits the save button, hoping to hear from the lovely lady from New York who also feels lonely.  Perhaps they can be new friends?  Perhaps they could be more?  Perhaps their conversation will end after and exchange or perhaps he will never hear from her.  It doesn't matter.  Its a risk, but one that he is willing to take to."

It's not like we're saying ""Hey Ju'Wuan, go fuck yourself your playing guard now"" he just has to move inside because it's what's best for the team. He's not going to be ignored during practice or anything like that, it's just what's necessary to improve our O line. He'll be playing LT for the first couple weeks anyways until Albert comes back, and who knows, if he's improved enough at LT Albert might play inside. It's not some sort of punishment to play inside, lineman should be flexible at this level. "

"Just fine. If we want to eliminate all the bad things, we could just shut down all power production, stop driving cars, and all farm for sustenance. The problem is that all the advanced medicine, clean water, reliable power, convenient transportation, including lightning fast emergency vehicle response come at a cost. Small degradations to air quality is one of those costs. We've made great improvements from the 80's, but not knowing when to stop is what's driving us to ridiculous lengths. We simply can't have everything right now without fossil fuels.

Save your favorite rides for early in the morning or late at night. Use fast passes starting when the park grows busy.

Don't walk the park backwards when arriving in the morning. Instead, immediately go to the most popular ride you want to ride.

You should factor it in if you need time off. Everyone needs a holiday but I don't think some people should get a bonus 3 month holiday every time a woman they spunked inside shoots out an infant.

Hunters for hire doesn't take ANY time, it's just a passive way of accumulating heavy armor spheres so that you don't need to do these quests anymore. The best nodes for heavy armor spheres don't give enduring charms, thus in a charm farming way, a waste of time. If you only go for the rare nodes, then you get like no heavy armor spheres. 2-3 heavy armor spheres 2-3 strong armor spheres? Try 0-2 heavy armor spheres, 2-6 strong armor spheres. I have way too many strong armor spheres.

It's pretty darn tedious to farm heavy armor spheres in those gathering tours/charm runs. I have ran through more than 100 heavy armor spheres. This was a **tip** to get heavy armor spheres in the least amount of *effort* possible, not me asking people to get lectures on how to go gathering -__-"

The fact that they saw the movie and set out to find it _is_ the story. Anyone can happen upon a boot that turns out to be exactly the specific boot the happened upon.

"I'm 15 years old and this is my pov. 

I think you overestimate the ""rage"" and ""anger"" these kids have. It almost feels a bit belittling which you probably don't intend to but still. I had my fair share of rage sessions but I can assure you. MOST RAGING KIDS ACT LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE UPSET. As you mentioned self respecting adults don't behave like this because they know it won't help and they learned through life how to handle their anger. 

These kids are going through puberty and don't really know how to handle their frustration so they type curse in caps but most people are just grumpy and not furiously typing and repeat their words in anger as you read the message. 

Sure some kids do that, but this is probably not that big of a percentage. As for smashing keyboards and throwing stuff at walls. Please don't say it is because of videogames because that's just blatantly naive. I'm sure you as a kid had angry moments when you shouted and released anger in physical actions, most people have had this, are having this or will have this.

"&gt; like Emma, her story is particularly moving

It isn't. It's the same old ""if you don't believe me you hate women"" bullshit, like what Emma's and ""Jackie""'s (false) stories were or are rooted in. 

&gt; I really reflected on the last few paragraphs in her defense of Emma and other women affected by campus sexual assault

There's nothing to reflect on, outside of the chances that girls like this are making things up, and how they're really poisoning the atmosphere when it comes to talking about rape or sexual assault as a phenomena in any way.

&gt;&gt; If you’re reading this and doubting Emma—if you’re reading this and doubting me—please ask yourself why I’m taking the time to write this.

As someone who doubts or outright doesn't believe either of them, I'd say it's really because she wants to shame anyone who doesn't accept her word as fact, and Jezebel is the go-to source for passive-aggressive supporters of third wave feminism. 

&gt;&gt; Ask yourself why I filed a complaint against someone I had considered a friendly acquaintance (before my assault). 

You either operate on some ridiculously broad definition of what constitutes sexual assault, or you're lying. Those are, realistically, the most likely reasons when no one does anything or doesn't take it seriously because there's absolutely no serious evidence. 

&gt;&gt; Ask yourself why four unrelated people have taken the time and energy to come forward and file complaints against him.

Didn't hear about it and I don't doubt that there's pretty good evidence that disproves those allegations, considering that nothing's come of them.

Rape hysteria bullshit, for the most part. I would say that the rates of sexual assault and worse are a lot lower then how these people allege.

You don't get to complain if you have no proof that something happened and then I don't believe you if you have no proof.

"I was the kid in school that was much older mentally than my peers (an old soul if you will). The teachers were pretty candid with me and we shared quite a few laughs. My two favorite shit talk moments were as follows:

1) I was the head of tech in drama. Tech attracted lazy dipshits. I sent a kid to go test a floodlight for the auditorium aka literally just plug it in to see if it works. I end up going to look for him 20 min later and he's sitting there watching it smoke. After much yelling on my part, I tell the theater teacher what a fucktard he is and he starts calling the kid 'goofy bastard'. The whole class called the kid GB the rest of the year

2) we had an autistic kid who loves anime and wearing crazy hats in AP U.S. history. He sat behind me and another kid who was a military buff. The military buff would constantly bring up irrelevant military shit during discussions. When the teacher rearranged the seating chart with us 3 together, he commented that he had all three ppl that answer questions together. Me who knew what I was talking about. Military buff to say something irrelevant. And autism to say something totally weird. 

Looking back, I peaked in high school"

"&gt;When Bush came in the DOW was around 1350 

No it wasn't. It never reached that number under Clinton.

&gt;the budget was balanced and on track to completely eliminate the debt by 2010 

I would like a source on that other than the Clinton Administration.  I hate to have to say this, but it is necessary in this subreddit, I voted for Obama.  However, you're just spewing nonsense and things that can't be measured so far.  

Bush fucked up with Iraq so I won't touch that.

&gt;When he left office the DOW was at 6500 (cut in half), 

Why though, are we doing to blame that all on one person? Bush is responsible for the housing collapse that happened due to legislation that was passed before he took office?  This also coincides with your first comment, but, Bush inherited a recession.  FACT.  I don't even like the guy.  I just like history and politics and hate to see people lie or misconstrue facts  just to grab favor when there is plenty to criticize him on.

&gt;At the time of this writing The DOW is over 18,000 (that's right, 3 times what it was when ~~Bush~~ Cheney left office) 

Right, during one of the biggest bubbles popping we have seen in a while. Meanwhile the Dow peaked at around 14k, in his second term, under Bush when shit was going okay.  Far from your 3 times number which is made just to blame one person exclusively for a problem perpetuated by government and the private sector as a whole.

The Dow is at 18,000?  With Republicans in charge of the purse strings in both legislative bodies?  Well let's be sure to give that credit to Obama just as Bush gets credit for the housing collapse while having the Democrats in charge of Congress because of a bipartisan bill that was passed before he took office.

"Well, she never said ""No""  nor she was anything but passive.

Plus, she was with her husband on their wedding night.

So, it is reasonable (given the circumstances and the lack of disagreement from her) for her husband to have thought that she consented.

.

Now, we all know that her husband, Bolton, is a major creep/psychopath.  So, we view the sex as undesirable.  But in order to be ""rape rape"" (to use Whoopie Goldberg's term)  Bolton would need to know it was non-consensual.

We also know, Bolton being a psychopath, that if consent was not given, it would have resulted in ""rape rape""

.


**Also, the whole lack of reaction to the rape that happened in the first season makes the reaction to this rape seem very hypocritical.**

.

In the last year [a number of high profile ""rapes"" have been proved patently false or hoaxes](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/?s=TEACH+WOMEN+NOT+TO+LIE+ABOUT+RAPE) (e.g., UVA, Columbia, etc.).  The [rape-rate has dropped nearly 50% since a high in the 1990s](http://cdn.pjmedia.com/instapundit/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gender1.jpg).  And, yet we are told we need to end due process for rape cases.  We are told that [we need to re-define rape such that normal human interactions would be considered rape](http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/20/feminists-want-us-to-define-these-ugly-sexual-encounters-as-rape-dont-let-them/).  We are told that questioning the allegations of an alleged ""victim"" amounts to rape-denial (which would mean that Atticus Finch was a rape-denier).

The whole thing smacks of the [1980s child-molestation hysteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria), and the pre-1960s lynching of black men for their supposedly non-consensual relationships with white women.

He goes, once there his mother gives him a room with a new gaming rig and what not, and because they're on a country with snow (how about a movie made in sweden?) she gives him a new car, a tuned 2004 Subaru WRX, who was previously owned by, not Jacob, but a girl living there who used to live in the US like him and now lives in Sweden, played by Cara Derevigne, she's super into cars and what not. Once he goes to school he meets, not Edward, but Jennifer Lawrence, a blonde, sexy vampire whos attracted to him because of his nerdiness and knowledge about things.

Clever Phil.

Because reddit is known for people only upvoting the truth.
"This article is nothing but propaganda.

Every election, we are urged to get out and vote. Every election, we're told that our vote can be more powerful than it has been in a long time. And after every election, the system keeps on chugging along as it did before.

For a long time, people have known, deep down, that their vote doesn't matter. This is why many don't bother to vote. Some might show enthusiasm and belief in the democratic ideals but how many will risk their life and livelihood to vote on polling day? Voting is not *that* important.

I mention this out loud and the Cheerleaders for Democracy accuse me of being apathetic and negative. ""People died for your right to vote,"" they say. ""Do them the honour of exercising that right."" No. They didn't die for me. They died for themselves and for their beliefs. I do not share those beliefs.

Jesus died for the Christians. Ostensibly he died for All Mankind but is it socially acceptable for Christians to tell Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus or Muslims to go to church because Jesus died for their sins? No. Yet believers in the secular religion of Democracy feel entitled to tell everyone that they need to pray regularly at the altar of the State.

Followers of the Cult of the State say I'm simply being lazy or disinterested in world affairs. Just this week, a US-based company asked me to do some work which I quoted up to $3,000 USD. We were on the verge of signing the contract but the company required I sign an IRS form related to US tax withholding. I told them that the IRS had no authority over a British Citizen running a British company performing work on British soil. I have no obligation to the US Government while working in my own country. They insisted so I declined the work.

It was a simple form and the company had kindly pre-filled all the details. All I needed to do was sign my name and they would give me their business. $3,000 USD is not a huge amount but it's not small either. Frankly, I could have done with the extra money. I voted when I turned it down. That's how I cast my vote, routinely throughout the year during the course of my day-to-day life. And yet I'm called apathetic by people who think freedom means queuing up every few years to tick boxes. How many times would they take part in the process if it cost them $3,000 for the privilege?

Acknowledging the flaws of democracy isn't being apathetic. It's being realistic.

Yes, it's possible to consent non-verbally. I'm not saying it isn't. I'm saying there's no reason not to ask if you think they do consent anyway. I'm not talking about people both making a move at the same time and kissing each other where verbally asking isn't necessary, I'm talking about resistance to the idea that they should ask at all. People aren't reluctant to ask because they think it will kill a mood, but because they think the answer might be no. 

That guy is a creep. But the way I see it, it's the same issue with a different situation. People do sometimes avoid asking so they can avoid giving an opportunity for ""no."""

Yup, they're both human beings. They both feel pain. They both take up space and exist through time. See how I reacted? See how I realized that there are similarities without flipping out? This is what you should be doing. But what's your point? Analogies don't exist in a vacuum, they exist to support a claim. What claim are you making based upon this analogy?

But some other guy who has internet access, goes online and reads GRRM's answer to a fan's question. So that means that you never get this major nugget of information because you don't go online?

Well, apart from the cynical view of Lawsky's real motives, the DFS and the licensing requirements have a legitimate reason to exist: to try to prevent  scams and unsafe services being offered to 12 million of NY residents who, for the most part, cannot be expected to understand the traps and risks of complicated financial services, or to know the insides of the company.

That is why any company that wants to offer financial services must provide a detailed description of the service that it intends to offer, identify all key people and partners, post bonds, demonstrate competence and integrity, etc.  Obviously, it would not make sense to have that approval process, and then let the company make arbitrary changes to the service after it was approved.

"Boxers are trained significantly better than most MMA guys still. Boxing is still a much harder sport to dominate than MMA because it has a more exact rules of what you can and cannot do so your skill set has to be more precise. Speed and leg work for instance of far more paramount in boxing than in MMA.

This also means more people can compete in MMA than in boxing because if you don't have the hand speed for boxing, your just fucked. In MMA you can try to make up for one weakness with another strength, in boxing you have to be good at those fewer ways you have to win fights. 

It's definitely a more elite sport, whether or not it's more entertaining is subjective.

"Totally agreed.  I feel like asking your SO to read a book about something that is deeply important to you is totally reasonable.  If she can't even do that, then she's shut down and stopped listening.

This is assuming that she's not already knowledgeable on the subject of polyamory, maybe.  If she already understands it well, and has decided that it's not right for her, then there's nothing you can do.

That said, you can't give her a book and expect her to change her mind.  I'm sure that's not what you were doing, but that's probably what it feels like to her.  Can you find a way to tell her that it's important to you that she understand polyamory, even if that means the two of you ultimately decide that it's not right for you?

"People don't usually cheat for no reason- some people are just shitty, but in a lot of the cases it's because the cheater's partner isn't fulfilling something. I've seen people cheat because they weren't getting validated, because they were lonely, the sex died off, the spouse wasn't home, etc. They all tried to talk to their spouse and the spouse just kept up whatever they were and weren't doing, so the cheater decided to cheat. That's pretty understandable.

 But, if she hasn't communicated to you in any way that you're not showing enough affection or whatever, even that isn't really an understandable reason to cheat, So..I guess what I'm saying is she just sounds like a shitty person

Evidence for her being shitty- instead of discussing any possible issues when caught, she made excuses about it and lied further. Why would you need a secret phone to text your friends on? Why is a co-worker setting her up on a blind date to begin with? "

"Hey everyone,

You may have seen my [post](https://i.imgur.com/rfDaF38.jpg) a little while ago with my rebel problems.

I am proud to announce that I finished my first full game of EU4 playing as Brandenburg and forming Germany while staying afloat. 

The same friend played in this game as well, playing as Genoa and forming Italy. 

I was actually was the emperor of the HRE for a pretty long time and passed all the reforms up to (but not including) ""Ewiger Landfriede"" because
I'm Germany and I'll declare wars if I want to. 

I ended up losing Emperor status towards the very end and Austria regained control of it. I actually dismantled the HRE towards the end because I was in
a war with Cleves, Ulm and Austria, whose capitals needed to be occupied to dismantle the HRE. 

We also decided to war Kebab with the help of Baguette. After that, we broke alliances with Baguette and attacked them. Then we truce broke and did it some more.

All in all, very fun first game. I'm still a bit of a noob, but I learned a lot through trial and error. "

Also, why would we need CTE for DLC content when every other game in the world does not have a CTE for their dlc. The DLC will work because the game isnt broken.

Also, this isnt BF4 and nothing needs prototyping as the game is a basic cookie cutter release which will just have its DLC's released and nothing else. This isnt DICE LA that is running this, its VICERAL so they wont be taking tons of ideas and implementing them in game."

"He probably came to these ideas because of all the threads on here that demonize black people behind a very thin veil of ""black culture"". What exactly does that mean? Reddit likes to pretend that the issues that are going on in American slums are solely the product of rap music instead of the other way around. It's like the issues of poverty and oppression that plague those areas aren't the actual issues. If they just stopped listening to Lil Wayne songs on their stolen iPods and got a job then all the problems in the ghetto would be solved. They're just not trying hard enough, and it's ""black culture"" to stay poor and criminal. That's the general reddit view right? It's ""black culture"" and not ""American culture"". I mean it's not like poverty brings crime in all areas of the world or something. Even in the nations where there is hardly a black population. I know reddit likes to pretend like colonialism, slavery, and Jim crow doesn't matter anymore but it does. Your ancestors - as close to present day as the 60s - were definitely better off socially than most black people could have ever hoped to be just by default of not being black. The system was literally set up so black people could not move forward. I would say that even in the 80s and 90s you still had widespread racism in corporate offices. Even to this day you will find some hold outs in elite circles that refuse women and minorities. This shit has a real effect on society. Social mobility is rarely huge steps. If you compare where a lot of black people to where their parents were, where their grandparents were, so on and so forth -  I'm willing to bet you don't find a lot of backsliding on the social mobility scale. So keep that in mind the next time you go off on 'black culture' or take part in the next 'black culture' blaming thread.

So basically in the hierarchy of things sales tax hits the poor the most, followed by flat tax, and then finally graduated taxes.

So that is why Rauner wants ""sales taxes"". Republicans always push tax burden upon the people least able to pay it. Its why they want graduated taxes replaced with a flat tax, and flat taxes replaced with sales tax."

&gt;Instead they ratified a constitution that, as tetondon's link points out, also eliminated that one particular states' right, but in the pro-slavery way.

Well it became a moot point when they created a country with only slave-owning states. Securing the right to own slaves did not mean they were not free to abolish slavery. Besides, the Confederacy was pretty different to the USA and states had much more autonomy, which is partly why they didn't win the war, ironically enough (lack of a strong, cohesive structure that could produce a unified plan)."

* 1/4 cup canned pumpkin
* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

* 1 cup flour

Mix the pumpkin, peanut butter, egg, cinnamon, and salt. Mix in the flour 1/2 cup at a time. Once fully mixed, knead the dough for 10 minutes.

"(Please don't take this towards you, this is towards the larger issue I've seen of this on our Blues sub)

For fucks sake, I'm tired of people using terms such as they didn't have enough ""grit"" ""heart"" ""show up"" ""want it"" when describing our players.

I'm sure many people here have played or currently play hockey or some other competitive sport.

I swam and played water polo. If you had ONCE come up to me and said I didn't have heart and didn't want it after a tough loss I would have ripped your fucking throat out.  You don't get to this level but not wanting victory.

So yes, they players have to ""show up,"" and they may not perform well or get the job done regardless of the coach, but don't tell me for a fucking second that they aren't out there giving it there all every game.  You don't get to the NHL by being okay with losing.  

It's to the point for me where the players have ""shown up"" in the regular season but haven't ""shown up"" in the post season. Doesn't that seem fishy. Sure, playoffs are a bit different but you mean to tell me the players are just completely shitting the bed? It has to be management and coaching, which by the way

RAY FUCKING BENNETT Has been with the blues since 08, thru 4 coaches.

BRAD FUCKING SHAW had been with us since 06. 

Management is bringing everyone back and they expect things to change. We'll coast through the regular season and finish top 3 in the division (if the players don't tune out hitch by then, which Backes, Oshie, and Stastny have all admitted to), we might finish at the top again and then get knocked out in the first round.

Why Did You Capitalize Every Single Word?
"I would assume that Bungie (or Activision) state in the EULA (and/or the terms of service, other licensing documents, etc.) that they retain all rights associated with in-game characters, resources, etc.

Among those rights would be the copyrights governing (1) all the game code related to ingame characters, (2) all the individual artistic elements used to create ingame characters (think textures, 3d models, etc.), and (3) any and all ingame ""characters"" sufficiently distinct to qualify for copyright protection.

In other words, from Bungie's perspective, you have a license to install and play Destiny, and create characters (using their properties) in order to accomplish that.  As far as copyright is concerned, one characterization of the rights at issue would be that you, as an authorized player, have the right to *reproduce* Bungie's copyrighted content for the limited purpose of downloading, installing, and playing the game.  Nothing more.

So no, from a strictly legal standpoint, your plan might (arguably) be infringing - a painted reproduction of a Destiny character exceeds the strict license you have as a player.  But I can't imagine trying to make that argument in court... I think you'd have a good fair use defense, and it might be de minimis, and a good lawyer could throw cold water on the breadth and specific enforceability of the EULA... who knows, maybe your custom avatar is a derivative work!

So, it's an interesting intellectual question.  Practically, though, go for it - sounds cool.  There's basically zero chance of Bungie taking any kind of action.  How would they even know?  And it would be lawyers going after you or the artist for something like this, not Bungie - Bungie probably loves it when fans do stuff like this."

"&gt;Stealing it because you don't agree IS FUCKING WRONG!

Ok, I think I've found the problem. You have an odd definition of right and wrong.

Here's another hypothetical for you! Person A has a movie. They say, ""hey, you should watch this movie, here's a copy!"" to Person B. Person B takes a copy of the movie and watches it. Person B hates/loves the movie and decides to destroy the copy/buy related swag.

**This is piracy**. How is it wrong? Who is hurt? There is no significant portion of pirates who can afford and would purchase things but don't because piracy is available.

&gt; It's not food or shelter, it's FUCKING ENTERTAINMENT. Find something else if you don't like it.

Fun fact, entertainment is a human need and, in the long term, is almost as essential as food and water! And once you've played a video game, playing ""throw the rock"" often simply doesn't fill that need.

&gt;If you can't grasp that simple fact, FUCK YOU. That's all. FUCK YOU. Stick with the other whiny pieces of shit here who use anything to justify how cheap they are.

You seem angry. Did you blame the failure of your shitty indie game on piracy?

Which automatically turn to Arin headbashing the same enemy over and over saying ''i just want to kill his guy that kils me in 2 hits in a room with 2 of them in a area i know nothing about''... it's DSP stuff... that's all.

I also have a PhD and when I told my SO at the time of an offer for a post-doc 2,000 miles away, the first thing he said was: I'm not moving to that state. That made it very easy for me to break up with him, pack my things, and start over. If you want an academic position in your country (or anywhere else for that matter), you know that a post-doc in the US, and publications from a respectable US lab/university, are going to look a lot better and increase your chances at a professorship a lot.

Right now, Reduced Mana is *required* to run auras.  With the change, you won't need the Reduced Mana gem to run those auras.

Otherwise it just results in a small QoL buff by giving a tiny bit more unreserved mana compared to without it, which simply might not be worth the cost of the gem or socket."

"It doesn't matter if the rich are more exponentially wealthy or not. The top 1% are still just that: 1% of the population. It doesn't matter if you raise taxes from 33% to 40% or from 33% to 60%, the amount of revenue the government would generate from such a tax would hardly help any sort of budget of that magnitude. All it would do is further exacerbate the issue due to economic repercussions. You're talking about raising taxes to the highest they would ever have been in history to take out a tiny chunk of the budget. It sure sounds glamorous, but ultimately, no one is better for a tax hike of that magnitude in the long run.

Edit: Seeing as I'm being downvoted for trying to explain a basic economic principal, allow me to link to a source explaining the [Laffer Curve](http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2004/06/The-Laffer-Curve-Past-Present-and-Future).

Like, for example, you could be offline in friends list but playing WoW so people see you in guild as online, or friends list. They could display you as offline in the game too, but that is probably problematic somehow.

I'd say you're probably right, it could probably be implemented across games without *much* issue (well, all games would need to be updated to support it) but since battle.net is so integrated with their offerings I think it presents gameplay problems so they don't feel like doing it."

"This is not true. Comparing a rapid fire bow to a spread bow directly isn't very good. Rapid/Pierce Up gives a 10% damage increase while Spread Up gives a monstrous 30% damage increase. That's like having Adrenaline +2 all the time!

L'Innocence is THE strongest bow for Shagaru where you can overcome frenzy. It's even very strong for other monsters where you can overcome frenzy on just raw alone even if they aren't weak to dragon. That 30% damage increase is no joke and it's what makes spread bows extremely strong in this game.

Everyone gives Kama so much praise but they forget about that damage boost on spread bows or they don't know abut it. Not only that, Rapid 5 has a total of 22% motion value while Spread 5 has a total of 26% motion value AND shoots an extra arrow for more element.

[T]he white Jefferson descendants who established the family denial in the mid-nineteenth century cast responsibility for paternity on two Jefferson nephews (children of Jefferson's sister) whose DNA was not a match.

Pretty sure you're looking at that completely backwards.

"&gt; The writer appears to be trying to drum up some sort of false equivalence in order to satisfy a kind of inner cognitive dissonance that says that because Muslims are a minority in the US, they can't be aggressors. 

It's because Muslims (like all minorities and majorities) are an extremely heterogeneous group that they can't be described, en mass, as ""aggressors"".

&gt; The author's attempt to smear Pamela Geller as a hate-speech extremist rings hollow given their deafening silence on issues like fatwas calling for the death of individuals deemed to have offended Islam[1] .

&gt; Where is the authors condemnation of ISIS as hate-speech extremists?

The author also doesn't denounce genocide in this article, but I can imagine that doesn't mean that they agree with it. I think it's sensible to assume that the author is opposed to ISIS hate speech.

&gt; So the attack on the United Nations compound in Afghanistan wasn't the result of the hate-filled minds of the men (and women?) who took out their rage on an innocent third party, but rather the result of the actions of some guy in the US exercising the very free speech that the author apparently applauds?

"I'm talking with a PvE perspective.

It sucks the life out of this game. You log in, you queue up, you port in, you afk, you get free purple. There is reward for doing nothing. That is the problem. And what happen when there is reward for doing nothing? Guess what? People will do nothing. 

You can argue that you pay $15 per month so you should have equal access to everything in the game as other players. Well newsflash, you do. You just choose not to do it. You don't have the time? That's YOUR problem. I don't have the time to run 10 level 100 alts with full garrison to get 100k gold per week, but you don't see me whining on the forum that I should get as much gold as the person who do. I spend time on my only garrison, get 10k gold per week out of it, and I am happy. At least in WoD they give LFR diabolically bad gears. That is one step towards the right direction. You afk through boss so you don't deserve tier pieces or trinkets.

You can argue that you don't want to deal with other people in pug group, or deal with the drama that comes with a guild. Well guess what? This is a MMO. Go play Skyrim instead.

Most of all, it deters potential new raiders. If a new player starts WoW and joins LFR, and sees all the toxicity in it, chances are they won't be interested in raiding at all. 

That's my two cents. Downvote away.

"Well, I suppose we can agree to disagree! I think the show is pretty much entirely flipping the Sand Snake story lines. In the books, they have several different plots to avenge their father, including raising an army to sack Oldtown, assassinating various Lannisters, and crowning Myrcella. That seems pretty different than the show version, which involves them all following Ellaria's orders and abducting Myrcella in an attempt to start a war. 

They are described to be cunning &amp; skilled fighters, which was why I called them badass. I'm disappointed because so far, the show is making them out to be pretty lame. I think it's mostly because the dialogue is so forced. "
"&gt; it's my understanding that if you're carrying a gun, you're much more likely to get shot.

Cite?  

Black US citizens represent about 1/7 the population of white US citizens.  When people in each of these demographics do murder, it is overwhelmingly within their own racial group.  But ... and this is the killer (so to speak), both groups commit approximately the same number of murders per year.  Another way to say this is that the murder *rate* in black America is roughly 7x that of white America.

Since we know that the overwhelming majority of citizens - white or black - do not do crime of any kind, and certainly not murder, you have to look at the sub-population of
each that's doing all the killing.  A bit of digging into US crime stats (I do not have them handy here) and you'll discover that the most likely place you will get shot (in the US) is in an urban ghetto with many young (18-34-ish) black males.  

The ""you're more likely to get shot if you carry"" is leftie anti-gun canard not rooted in much of anything in reality.  Oh, and - last I checked - private, armed citizens in the US stop more crime during commission than sworn law enforcement officers.

"Weapon balance is a very difficult subject.

Should they just nerf all semblence of originality and make every weapon fire the same way? Thorn loses its DoT and suddenly that TDYK is a Hawkmoon?

Unique weapon stats, make them unique, by removing originality this brings all players to the same level, sure, but this will make for boring gameplay. Players will always eventually use weapons that get the most kills in the shortest time, this is why every time there is a buff/nerf within a week people know which gun to use to get the most kills. It's an endless cat chasing its tail.

I personally don't think weapons need to be adjusted much any more, instead I think to make Crucible/IB/ToO a more ""level"" playing field, hidden weapon stats (specifically aim assist) need to be buffed/nerfed based on your overall K/D ratio. 

If you're a consistently low K/D player, you gain more aim assist, which will hopefully improve your K/D and when it gets high enough it tapers back reducing effectiveness eventually reaching a point where it 'hovers' with consistency. Conversely, extremely talented players will have reduced aim assist which means they can depend on their existing skills to be their crutch. Giving too much aim assist to exceptional players leads to the current level of imbalance more than actual weapon being overpowered."

It wasn't something to be proud of, owning a computer.  It's like the quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, near the beginning: ""I asked for a car, I got a computer.  How's that for being born under a bad sign?""  Yes, of course most every teenager would prefer a car, but it was an era that a computer would kill your social life.  Nerds had computers.  Nerds were the lowest form of life in the school social hierarchy.  It was never a console vs. PC during that era, because it was best not to admit you had a PC.  "

And going to see a movie, there's always someone there on the phone talking (as well as the light clearly shining from their phone).

It also brings a lack of privacy.  And I'm not talking about the government being able to track everywhere you've been, because the phone has a GPS.

"I like your list of advice, but feel that is a bit overwhelming and almost anxiety-creating for a newbie. The food list is gold, though.

IMHO the most important thing to do is go on a food tracker like MFP and punch in what you plan to eat. There is a huge AHA! there for most people regarding how much they actually eat, and where the hidden carbs lie. 

It is easy to overeat on keto if you are used to eating out of boredom, socially or to elevate your mood. It is no magic bullet, just a tool to make things easier when it comes to weight loss. 

I refused to log food for the longest time, and my weight charts shows a flat line until the day when I finally gave in and started tracking.

So, seriously, TRACK YOUR FOOD."

Muslims can have it both ways apparently, but what do the men in power care, same as everywhere. And I can think of Islamic culture that reinforces things that are equally bad or worse than FGM, so I think you're missing the point.

I'm not middle aged, but I'm older than 9, and I think I probably enjoy the movies in a very different way than I would have when I was younger.

If you want to go home earlier, ask your boss to close the store 30 minutes earlier... see how far that gets you. If you own your own store, then just close 30 minutes earlier.

"A common misconception.  Any time one is dealing with an interpersonal legal issue, a lawyer's work is maybe 75% law, 25% psychology (ie ""life advice"").  And the latter percentage can go up drastically (like to 75%+) depending on just how crazy the parties are.  It's rather amazing how many ""legal"" problems are actually nothing more than ""clashing personality"" problems.

That's why even paid lawyers will dish out some life advice with their legal analysis .  The two are usually so inexorably intertwined that you really can't have without the other, and neglecting to give your client ""real world"" advice is doing them a disservice."

They can't tow you while you're in it. And, if the cop sits waiting for the guy to leave the RV to them get a tow truck... the only losers are tax payers. 

Plus the only person we know was an Adult was the cop even though he didn't act like it. Adults don't write a ticket because someone confronted them with a camera or acted a jerk. 

If the cop wasn't going to write a ticket then he shouldn't have said he was going to at the end. If you're that thin skinned I suggest a cop finds a different career.

When two people are very emotionally close it tends to remove the core element to the nature of attraction, which namely is difference. 

For instance you are not attracted to yourself and if you are in unison with someone then it as if they are an extension of yourself and the sense of wonder and attraction is extinguished. 

On the other end of the spectrum is total mystery, an unfathomable partner who comes and goes as they pleases and cannot be controlled in any sense. This partner will be seen as very attractive. But they will be a serious problem in the fact there is zero comfort, safety and trust in such as arrangement. 

I think balancing such factors between comfort and attraction is a core requirement for making a relationship function well. This is not even red pill, which goes many steps further, but this is important information that kind nice men do not go into and discuss. "

It's funny how you defend people who are rich enough to stuff their faces with McDonald's and tell other's that it's healthy and perfectly fine and yet ignore the fact that *actual* oppressed working class people of the world including minorities I wholeheartely defend.

I've worked in the shoe industry and your figures are completely wrong. Fuck off.
"&gt; only 1 (maybe 2 ) people died during the 2010 south africa stadiums building and they were given a memorial.

That's the official number. I can't find a more recent statement but [as of May 2014, officially there were zero work-related deaths on the 2022 sites](http://www.arabianindustry.com/construction/news/2014/may/14/qatar-official-denies-world-cup-deaths-4698733/#.VVn16UawTQA). I don't believe that for a second - it would make it the safest construction project in human history - but there is often a big difference between the official figures and the actual figures so I wouldn't put much trust in the South Africa numbers.

However on the other hand the papers have all been reporting the total death rate for all migrants across the country, including deaths from natural causes, and including deaths of workers who have nothing to do with the world cup. They don't discriminate between work-related deaths and natural deaths, which massively bumps up the figures. This is similarly dishonest.

&gt; your article is outdated and shows 12 stadiums. 

That's the latest official statement so I don't have anything more up to date."

"I think you could afford to be more critical about your own assumptions.

While race affects rate of arrest, rate of incarceration and severity of sentences, and I don't expect you to dispute this because you can look it up, if you don't believe that any of this is discriminatory, then you believe that all of the difference in judicial outcome across races is due to some races engaging in more or more severe crime. 
Do you know that?

Even on the assumption that some races are more criminal than others, are you also assuming that this has nothing to do with having reduced opportunities due to discrimination (whether historical or in the present)? That's something else you should examine. You could just assume that it is biological like sickle cell but that would be pseudoscience.

It's not just that races are biologically unique - everyone is biologically unique. What makes the biologically unique traits attached to race (like sickle cell or Tay-Sachs) more important than all the other traits that are not attached to race?

In the US, police ARE mostly white. Look it up.

I think you can recognize it would be much too strong to assert that no blacks or other minorities face systematic discrimination in the US. Systematic discrimination is a very common thing in the world and the US isn't exceptional there, unfortunately. but you might have to do your own homework to find any of the many, many kinds of evidence of this rather than expecting reddit to spoonfeed you."

"How does the problem get solved though? You talk about people grouping up and protesting and this and that, but does anyone actually understand what it is they're protesting?

Cops don't target black youths by accident. There's a reason for everything. The reason might not be good but there always is one. In this case, it's the perception that black youths are the most likely to commit a crime, be defiant, etc. and you want to know whose fault that is? Black youths. I'm not trying to generalize here and I'm absolutely not being racist. The reason black youths have that reputation is because a lot of them actually earned it - a lot more so than other races. I don't know why, but that's just how things happened.

The problem isn't *just* that police target black youths, it's also that there's enough black youths acting in a certain way that puts a target on the rest's back. Protesting, marching, etc doesn't address that aspect of it, and it's enough of a problem that it needs to be addressed in one way or another."

"Maybe because people who vote most are centrists, and they believe that voting for someone who isn't 'fringe' or 'has no federal experience' is a safer vote.

I really don't get this obsession with the NDP at all. I don't see Mulcair or this roster of NDP having done anything to prove they would be great leaders of the country. Of course history can't either, but I don't think in this era post-Harper that rolling the dice with an inexperienced party is the best option.

That and the standard of living isn't that great either.

Furthermore, what the fuck does an L2 switch have to do with a virtualized router?

IB can't pass IP? What? I guess you haven't heard of IPoIB. Granted IB has not been historically been achievable for the home lab, but with prices as they are now (incredibly affordable) and the fact the tech runs on all OS', it's readily available.

because XJ9 taught her how to play (according to her FAQ/facebook). also, note that they duo'd when he was unbanned as well. he live tuaght her how to jungle with his carry style.

what bs? she doesn't want cam/voice (she does voice sometimes, I've watched) because it distracts her from playing well. also she doesn't want people to watch just for being a girl. whether it's his gf or not playing, he dfinitely does have that girlfriend. back when he was briefly unbanned and streamed on hitbox you could hear both talking together."

"&gt;&gt;supposition, an uncertain belief.&lt;&lt;

Nah, I wouldn't call it that at all. I mean I understand and agree with your argument that it can't be 100%. I mean I see a lot of this with my friends when we play DnD; the need to explicitly say every little thing.

But this isn't DnD. His comments weren't made in a vacuum of sci-fi lore, they were made in reality. And in reality, we are lucky enough to where we can use higher-level thought processing and deduce from context. 

To what end in this circumstance? None at all since the map will be redone for obvious reasons. And the argument that if Beer didn't show us this plot.ly that more people would have an advantage falls on it's face before you even finish reading this sentence because of that. And I know that wasn't what you were saying, but this entire comment section is filled with empty comments like that. 

The kind of comments that make sense, until you take a step back and take in the obviousness of the situation. "

"Far less, all the operator does is keep the crosshair on the target. 


Edit: 

&gt;...Thereafter, all operations are automatic and the gunner’s only task is to maintain alignment of the sight reticle on the target until missile impact.

http://i.imgur.com/YMLCQae.png 

&gt;When the missile appears in the sight picture, ignore it. Never try to guide the missile. If distracted, tracking becomes poor and chances of hitting the target are reduced. Continue to track the target at a smooth tracking rate, keeping the crosshairs on the center of visible mass until missile impact (Figure 5-12).

Fuck sake please don't let it be an xbone exclusive.
"First let's clear some things up. Yes I am aware of what I am comparing, but this is closer to this conflict than you'd think. The Russians continue to maintain their neutrality and non-involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, believing that they are doing nothing wrong, similar to how the Chinese are utterly convinced that they are doing the right thing. 

Also, Vietnam and also the Philippines fortifying and colonising the islands have been reported on for years, and the same applies to Chinese actions in the past, but haven't garnered a lot of attention in the international media because of the rslative insignificance of those actions, compared to the large scale actions which include dredging and land reclamation, as well as the construction of military bases which we are discussing at the moment. 

Besides this, Chinese domination in the area is a far greater threat to the US and the West in general than if Vietnam or the Philippines could ever pose, which caused the press to overreact even further. 

And lastly, the source for the Chinese claim is so transparent and laughable that it makes for a good story for the media to spin. 

Now that we've cleared that up, let me repeat my stance on this matter. Any construction undertaken in disputed land is per definition a hostile act to the other claimants, it's, from their perspectives, a foreign power exercising control over what they see to be their land. 

I agree with the US in calling upon all the nations involved to cease construction in the area until the dispute is resolved. The nations in question see this differently of course, because again, from their perspective, it's rightfully thekr land to do with what they wish. "

"Remember all the wealth created in the wake of FDR's policies?  Yeah, me neither.

Alternatively, the period after that brought us Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, Eric Schmidt, Elon Musk, Sumner Redstone, Seymour Cray, Larry Ellison, The Koch's, The Walton's Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerburg, Sheldon Adelson, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, The Mars family, George Soros, Carl Icahn, Steve Balmer, Phil Knight, Laurene Powell Jobs, Michael Dell, Paul Allen, Rupert Murdoch, Jack Taylor, Charles Butt, Harrold Hamm, Patrick Soon-Shiong, and many more.

That's just the billionaires, and that is not a complete list.  The number of millionaires would be in the thousands.

None of those people were even millionaires under the FDR economy, many were not even born, and for each one in the list there are a hundred more people who worked with them that rose to wealth in the last 4 decades.

I think I left out the hundreds of millionaire athletes created in the U.S. in the past several decades.

The reality is that wealth has diversified dramatically in the last 4 or 5 decades, and there are millions who have benefited from it.

You just chose to focus on the wrong things.  I don't remember the number of millionaires/billionaires growing so dramatically under FDR's policies."

"Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging. Though the term anal sex most commonly means penile-anal penetration,sources sometimes use the term anal intercourse to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and anal sex to refer to any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation."

"Private providers can do whatever they want given that they are ""private"", ei not public. Now you can argue all you want about Housing NZ, whether it is providing enough or not and I would not make a sound about it, because I honestly just do not know enough about the subject. I never once used the term ""common sense"" and I would appreciate it if you did not make assumptions about my motivations. My opinion is based of the fact that there should be a single dedicated agency dealing with social services, having multiple agencies pursuing the same goals is redundant by definition. I certainly do not think that the councils have a duty to step in somewhere outside their direct responsibilities. It is like asking the Fire Service to repair houses after a fire, just because the home-owner did not have proper insurance. Feedback CCC receives from social housing residents is biased by definition and it should be be regarded as such. I am sure it is overwhelmingly positive because they are getting something for a much lower cost then they otherwise would have. Feedback that CCC receives from ratepayers is by far more relevant and not nearly as overwhelmingly supportive or satisfied with the housing management by the council. The council has an accountability and responsibility TO ALL ratepayers and not just a disadvantaged few. In addition to that the City Council should not be a redistributive agency either."
"""Supposed"" to be used? Those are direct copy/pastes of the dictionary definitions of those words. Pretty hard to ""twist"" that.

The quote is not about experience since Nietzche has not met every woman on the planet.

Attributing his disappointment to his own inflated expectations is the strongest argument brought up so far, but nowhere in the quote does he imply that he is at all responsible for his ""frequent lows"".

I remember when someone found a trick in Halo Reach that you could keep reloading a quick save with a crazy laser weapon that carpet bombs the area you put the light on. You would earn points by killing a huge wave of grunts and elites, so after you would do that you earn points towards in game achievements if I recall, but you could die and reload the save with the item in hand and the covenant repawned too so you could keep grinding these points.

"Right, it's disgusting to your sensibilities but it doesn't make it any less the truth; your ideals and values are going to be out of sync with how people behave on the ground in a total war every time. And personally, it's not about being ""better"" on the sliding scale of your own personal ethos which I and many other may not share. No one has ever emerged from a war such as this by being ""better"", which presumably means more merciful. 

The sad and shocking truth is that sometimes brutality and relentless attacks are what is required to win it and end it as quickly as possible, and your specific idea of what makes one side or the other better doesn't interest me. Only victory for the right does, Syrian triumph and liquidation of the enemy, his collaborators and his sympathizers no matter the way in which this is achieved. If you think it makes those saying the truth ""no better"" or ""worse"" then fine, I hope Syrians defending this great and unique country, this mosaic civilization from merciless foreign attack have it in their hearts and will to unleash the beast you think we are.

Just saying man, I literally only care for victory - it's my blood, my future, my family's blood, my family's future, the survival of our people and a homeland which can be raised up for the generations to come we leave it to, and the position of the Syrian nation in this world - nothing is more important than that; not our lives nor anyone else's. Everything is insignificant in comparison. 

Grandchildren of the Syrian race can be crowned as heirs to a victory of legend and the nation made an altar to ascend to the heavens, economically just and cooperative, intellectually and spiritually aspiring to new revolutionary heights. Like a phoenix from the ashes it will rise, but those who have come as the cuckolds of a foreign invasion by proxy, they will only find a tomb in Syria."

He starved his people, he purged his officers ( a large reason for the Soviets losing so bad in the early stages of operation Barbarossa). Stalin was a different kind of evil and if he had the means to take over Europe he would have no doubt did that. Hitler was insane, Stalin was ruthless.

I'm not saying that was definitely the case with Garrett, but I am saying you can't reason that because the team is good and talented now that Garrett therefore automatically deserves credit.

Inseamna ca isi incalca propriile valori. Leviticul face parte din Vechiul Testament si daca sunt ortodocsi trebuie sa ia in considerare in special Noul Testament (cronologic si logic), unde sunt o gramada de referinte pentru toleranta si mai ales impotriva pedepselor (""Cel care e fara de pacat sa arunce prima piatra"" etc).

"The only occupation is by Japanese for 30 years, and even that had bitter guerrila resistance. Koreans have fought tooth and nail against every other invasion using strokes of genius. Now the source of pure blood is not entirely political. Just compare Europe and EastAsia. According to Diamond's ""Guns Germs, and Steel"", Europe's geographical nature is favorable to multiple nations competing and intermixing. But in East Asia, there are only 3 distinguishing features. Mainland China, Korean Penninsula, and Japanese Archipelago. Korean nation state began to form in the 7th century, as large scale Chinese invasions pushed the people of the peninsula to band together (much like how Napoleonic invasions is considered to have solidified nations of Europe). You can take the case of Mongolian invasions as another possible occupation, but note that through bitter resistance from various mountain fortresses and the Royal retreat to the castles at Ganghwa island, Mongols sued for peace and superb diplomatic negotiations gained the Koryo king an actual vote in the Mongol Empire's Khan nomination system, right to self-rule, a military alliance, a garrison stationed just south of the Norther border, as part of assurance not to attack Mongolian mainland during its conquests in the West.

Why not lump all the alternate outfits into one DLC, too? It's all mismatched in terms of value and that makes the number ""16"" seem arbitrary and inflated.

"Ok. Lesson time: 

what do you think happens when you work out? Do you think you're just building up muscle mass, which raises testosterone? 

It's literally the exact opposite. When you work out, you are tearing down your muscle fiber. Testosterone levels rise as the body repairs the muscle. 

Now, translate this to a 10 year old. Hormone balance is a fine line. 10 year old tears his muscles up, testosterone raises. 10 year old does this repeatedly. Testosterone is now too high for his age, especially pre-puberty. Body stops producing testosterone to compensate. Boy stops growing.

You ever notice how a dog will respond to an adult more readily than a child? It's not the voice. It's because dogs know a child can't hurt them, but an adult can.

Paradigm shift in treatment of addiction holds promise, thanks to epigenetics

"A few reasons.

a.) Spanish is relevant solely because it's widely spoken, not because it's useful to know.  Getting a good job or into school is far easier knowing English, not Spanish.  English is the primary or widely spoken secondary language of every economically relevant nation on the planet.  On the he other hand, Spanish isn't.  

b.) a common language is a fantastic unifier.  It helps integrate communities and bring people together.  I'm all for people learning more than one language, but there is no reason why America should have to conform to the languages of outsiders, especially at cost to us (see California spending 22 BILLION dollars on ESL programs last year).  I have no problem with people teaching their children Spanish, Chinese, etc but if you come here for your own benefit and for the benefit of the nation, you should learn the de facto language, English."

And I'm probably the only person on the internet to admit this, but I know fuck all about WMDs. Someone talking about yellow cake and aluminum tubes, means nothing to me.

"Directly, depends. Indirectly, yes.

Directly - While fully clothed, my physique doesn't stand out. It also doesn't help that most American clothing is built for the average Caucasian male. A good portion of my wardrobe is either slightly too loose or slightly too short. Therefore, the ladies never get to see the goods.

However, I have caught several of my female friends and strangers looking when I have my shirt off, usually at the beach or while I was longboarding around in my undergraduate years.

Indirect - The most important thing is that you're confident in yourself. It helps when you like what you have in yourself. Whether it's the physique or knowing that you put the work in to get that physique, every bit helps with self-confidence. Girls love self-confident guys.

With me, I always feel a bit better about myself after a work out. I'll come back from the gym and still feel the pump in my muscles. I usually wear a tank top so I know my arms look pretty good. When I change into my clean clothes, they feel tighter, reaffirming my efforts. I know I subconsciously stand a bit straighter too.

Some advice about girls:

It helps to have a good wardrobe, good haircut, and good posture. In terms of wardrobe, most women I know like the business/business casual look. Basically, collars. However, the clothing must fit well. Slim fit works best for me and sometimes I take clothes to a tailor for some modifications.

For haircuts, I would say the majority like or don't mind a clean cut. Short on the sides and back, and a bit longer on the top. Don't do bangs. I've heard from many girls that they think it effeminates the guy. Instead, use a bit of product (I prefer wax or pomade) and just make a clean, professional look. While I don't think you have this problem since we're both Asian, avoid having facial hair. I know some girls like it, but I also know a lot that don't. The majority don't mind a clean shaven man.

Lastly, posture. Working out is going to improve your posture, both directly and indirectly. As you gain more confidence, you'll subconsciously straighten up, and the ladies will pick up on that. Your confidence will snowball and hopefully, you end up with someone you like.

Sorry for the long post. Hope it helped! Let me know if you have any other questions. Cheers!"

Bebe also promised that with a renegotiated TV deal, The conference would probably be able to pay out $20+ million per team in the future. A&amp;M said to give them that in writing, and that if the league didn't give them $20+ plus every year, they would bolt. The A&amp;M official in the article specifically said that **they didn't care where the money came from,** meaning that they didn't care if it was at the expense of other schools. A&amp;M wasn't tricked into looking like they didn't care about equal revenue sharing, they actually didn't care (because they were already on their way out of the conference). They were making overtures to the SEC long before that point, since just after the first PAC deal fell through.  "

"Hi Steve Campana. Lets talk about disgusting ethics in science. 

This shouldn't surprise you but I am not allowed to use, sell, opine or interpret any of the work I do at my job. Unless its FOR my employer.

In fact, legally and ethically and by common sense all that work is my EMPLOYERS PROPERTY. Seriously. It's theirs. They own it. They have all the rights to it. 

So you should understand that 1) this is STANDARD IN SCIENCE around the world. The employer owns that research. Not you. Not me. Its not 'yours' to take to a press conference, share with other employers or the public or really even your friends.

In this case, if someone is hired by the government to study anything from 'Climate Change' to 'Pollution' to whatever the case then what would be 'disgusting unethical and really 'illegal' in most cases' but disgusting would be the employee taking that property outside their workplace and giving their own out-of-work opinions, interpretations or just using it as their own data and their own research.

Nothing I'm telling Mr. Campana is any different than nearly EVERY READER HERE who's employed. They cannot take the code home and put it on their blog. They cannot publish their contract with criticisms and interpretations and get this...
.....even people reading this who work at some Fast Food Chain are not technically even allowed to take the recipes home, share their recipes in public etc.

I can't think of anything more 'disgusting' than a scientists who'd break their employers trust like that and then even worse cry about it when they get fired.

"&gt;On the other hand, an omnimax God could (presumably) have created a world without any suffering at all and decided not to which, from a purely utilitarian perspective, would be morally wrong.

I disagree.  I don't think a world could logically exist where suffering was not necessary.

""Suffering"" is a biological release of chemicals in response to negative stimuli.  The only world that could exist without suffering is one without a variance of conflicting stimuli.  Such a world would not only be pointless and boring, it would be flat and unchanging.  It would effectively be non-existence.

If you code a learning, self-replicating program that makes decisions and some decisions are bad for the survival of that program and some are good, over generations the negative stimuli will be experienced as suffering and the positive ones will be pleasure.  

Suffering is an illusion to keep our biological bodies alive for a while.  Sometimes it malfunctions and that sucks.  I'm personally in pain almost all day every day (family history of joint and muscle issues), it sucks, but it isn't immoral.  There's something wrong with my body and it is simply letting me know."

Also, other people are right in that, if it's a drug of any kind that's illegal, you might as well be fucked unless you shut yourself off from the world. So something does get done there.

"I'm arguing less about what should be ""allowed"" than what marriage actually *is*.

You seem to be saying that if marriage is procreative, then we should draw the line at fertility (at what point in time?) instead of sex.

If you're actually interested in understanding my position--and it's one I was led to for secular reasons after agreeing with your current position despite my religious beliefs--here's something I wrote on Facebook a while back.

&gt;The permission of non-procreating opposite-sex couples to marry/stay married is an interesting historical question as well as a philosophical one. We can look at historical societies that appeared to see marriage in a traditional/procreation-centric way (based on the exclusion of same-sex couples, presence of the usual norms including premarital virginity, public enforcement, lamenting of infertility within marriage, etc.). They always, as far as I can tell, allowed infertile and older couples to marry, and didn't split couples up if they were discovered to be infertile or became old (I don't know about married couples intentionally not procreating--that phenomenon is sort of peculiar to our society).

&gt;There could be a few explanations for this. One is that marriage isn't really structured around procreation. But I find this hard to buy, because there isn't a compelling alternative. All the marital norms that appear to serve procreative interests are near-universal, whereas alternative concepts of marriage (based on property interests, labor-sharing, etc.) don't seem to show up nearly as often. The one other explanation that does make sense to me is the sexual complementarity/organic bodily union/one flesh idea that Sherif Girgis likes. This seems to be how classical philosophers saw marriage, based on what they wrote about it. It's also consistent with most religious traditions. Procreation sort of flows naturally from the idea of complementarity, and honestly, I think the organic bodily union vision of marriage is closer to the truth than just marriage as procreation on its own. However, it's quite a nuanced argument, so I approximate it with procreation.

&gt;There's a second possibility. Even if you keep looking at marriage as a procreative union, I still think it makes sense to include infertile/elderly/non-procreating opposite-sex couples. Looking historically again for a moment, it seems that people were simultaneously able to see marriage as procreation-centric and to allow infertile couples to marry. However, by comparison, it does not appear that people can simultaneously view marriage as procreative and allow same-sex couples to marry. Indeed, nearly anyone who argues for same-sex marriage insists that marriage cannot be about procreation. Now, this difference could just reflect that people have always been bad philosophers. Or it could be that they were intuiting something about the nature of a person's sex and the nature of infertility. One is fundamental to a person's identity, the other contingent. And thus, changing marriage with respect to sex would be changing its form/structure, while changing it with respect to fertility would not be. This is debatable, but even if it's wrong or subjective, it's extremely practical. This is, first, because determining a person's sex is trivial, while determining their fertility is difficult and an invasion of privacy. Second, because people who have been unable to procreate fairly frequently become able. Third, because men actually often retain the ability to reproduce into old age, so having them marry serves a social purpose. Fourth, because non-procreating couples can adopt without leaving a child motherless or fatherless. All of these benefits and we don't appear to endanger the public vision of marriage as a procreative institution, which is what we need to stay aligned with the purpose of marriage.

&gt;One more thing: other visions of marriage are subject to the same criticism. If marriage is about love, then should we screen engaged couples to see if they actually love each other? Well, no. Ultimately, I think the soccer analogy still works.

EDIT: 

&gt;If one team shows up with a functional net and one team shows up with a ball then you say it's okay because it's the thought that counts. They still have a net. Your goal still can't be accomplished. Based on your rule (can't fulfill the goal) they shouldn't be able to play, but you're okay with that.

You're misunderstanding my ""rule"". What I said was that the team's form had to fit the purpose of soccer teams to be considered a ""soccer team"". (This is basic Aristotelian institutional stuff.) *Not* that the individual team has to fulfill the purpose of soccer teams.

EDIT 2: 

Also, the bit about one team bringing nets and balls is your extension to the analogy, not mine. I was only illustrating form and purpose in the context of institutions. Edit 3: Also, I'm not talking about whether anyone's allowed to play; they're all allowed to play, it's just whether they're a soccer team."

It's a buzzword that's a product of being sandwiched between the more established terms of ""free to play"" and ""pay to play.""  Without that knowledge, it's such a vague and, frankly, stupid sounding way to represent your game.

"Most of the lag on Retina Macs is due to the integrated graphics not being powerful enough to run scaled HIDPI modes. For example, if you run a 15"" Retina MBP at the 1920x1200 HIDPI mode (which internally renders everything at 3840x2400 and scales it down).

Solution:
Run either at the native HIDPI resolution or get a third party utility and run at a custom non-HIDPI resolution."

"Let's start by saying I'm not exactly a rocket surgeon, but I'm a fairly smart guy. I have been in two relationships like this in my adult life. One was with a girl who knew I was smarter, and so decisions requiring intelligence generally went to me while I left the things requiring feelings to her. I didn't hate her, but resented the fact that I just couldn't have discuss anything dealing with my job, science news, current events that weren't pop culture related, or pretty much anything besides the most awful and vapid crap without explaining every single fucking thing to the point where I just stopped talking to her at one point. She was sweet (completely insane though) and it was endearing at first because she genuinely seemed thirsty for knowledge. Turns out she just didn't understand, which made her just as frustrated as it made me.

The second was a huge victim of the Dunning–Kruger Effect. The less she knew, the more sure she was about how much better she was than others. She turned into a huge hosebeast and I ended up not being able to stand the sight of her."

"&gt; Assuming T. Gondii is responsible for crazy cat lady syndrome for one

Maybe it is not critical thinking skills you are lacking but reading comprehension. I guess all I can do is point out the obvious a second time.  
  
""Some argue that this parasite... may be the cause of the 'crazy cat lady syndrome'... and may even be responsible for some cases of schizophrenia"" is not the same as saying that it is proven or even assuming that is the case. What I put was a statement of fact that some people argue that is the case. I don't know how much more clarification or explanation is really required, but you have surprised me thus far. And to back up my assersion that some people argue it, there is an article provided of people arguing that point.  
  
To use your example, this would be like if the question was ""why do people not vaccinate their kids"" and you posted ""some people argue that MMR causes autism. Here is a link."" I could assume that you think MMR causes autism, but that just means I am a presumptuous twat."

I suppose you can do FE10 without doing that info conversation (I think it's needed to recruit Danved?), but they're are other indicators there, it's not in a totally optional chapter like Priam is, which is a lot of the reason i don't think he should be included in the canon."

Now, I'm not a doctor and don't know you at all so you decide if this could help your specific situation. If you think your muscles could be tight or you don't have a good range of movement it could be worth getting a stretch routine from a physio. If you want, that is :)"

"GGers are putting Denis fucking Dyack on the pedestal now? Jesus. Do you even know who this guy is?

Your cause is dead. It always was."
"Thanks for those details. I sympathize with your situation and understand how truly serious your scenario is. I have a couple follow up questions and points. So you tried these ""diets"" but the way you listen them it sounds like you tried gluten free and that didn't work..so then you tried vegetarian and that didn't work..then etc etc. What if your problem was a combination of a bunch of things? Maybe you had problems with dairy gluten and tomatoes but the way you listed it you would never know. Also how long did you attempt these diets?

 I'm not trying to doubt the science behind genetics being the cause and claim your wrong because I truly don't know but neither do doctors at this point. All they can look for is the antibodies and make conclusions based on skin and joint xrays. There's not an actual test that shows your PA is caused by genetics. That is also anecdotal. I will sau that your situation is severe to the point where I think diet isnt a realistic option since playing the waiting game, as you said, may lead to wheelchair or worse so I understand where your coming from. However, your personal accounts of attempting diet and detoxing sound unreliable. Now if you told me you truly attempted to heal ""leaky gut"" for 6 months plus and saw absolutely no improvement whatsoever then I would say you've made a fair case.

My point on Big Pharma is this. In terms of looking for a cure for psoriasis the research dollars would never go into funding dietary research because medicine is firstly a business. They would put in millions into research and in the end they don't get to sell you a pill or w.e.  which   would cause them to only loose money.. its not that I'm saying diet is the only cause of P/PA but to totally dismiss it because there is no scientific studies (which are almost exclusively funded by pharmaceutical companies) is naive. I don't think doctors are out to get me but I also realize that medical research is funded by big pharma and that's what they go off of. It's nothing against them or the other it's just capitalism."

"So you want him on 250+k a week??

Rooney was/is a special case. The 250k was because we desperately couldn't afford to lose him circa '12, especially not 3 years after losing Ronaldo and signing exactly 0 world class player in the interim. It would have been hugely damaging to the Utd brand, especially as he's English. Having England's best/most talented player generates a lot of extra attention/revenue.

And RVP was 29 years old.. and was a striker. Ergo he was more valuable than any keeper could be.

The absolute max I'd be willing to give DDG is 170k. That's about 60k more than Manuel frickin Neuer. Extraordinarily generous. Probably more than Madrid would give him, tbh. It's not like there aren't several great keepers around the world itching to replace DDG who we could easily sign. He's not irreplaceable."

"Probably for a number of reasons:

Riky has fallen out of favour in the current pub meta, and is outshined nowadays by other 'pubstomp' heroes, such as Dragon Knight and Razor. Why would you pick an invis hero and run the risk of detection, and therefore potentially lose the game if your team are relying on you as the hard carry.

On the note of your teammates not buying detection, dust and sentries can be expensive for poor supports in the early game, so if pushed for detection, you're mid should probably supply these after getting a fast bottle. 

You're teammates have to understand that buying detection, even at the cost of other early game items will mean a much easier laning phase, with the ability to zone him out and harass and possibly a few early kills on him which makes snowballing for him a lot harder. It also means that you can travel safely through you're jungle without being ganked by him, as squishy supports without an escape are easy targets.

Since the comeback mechanic was nerfed he has been less popular, as riky is one of those heroes who early game is pretty much useless until he gets his items, and if he doesn't snowball earlygame then it's pretty much over. If you have a good teamfight lineup he can really shine though, as his core diffusal will provide great debuffs on the enemy supports so they can be killed easily and quickly"

3. It's a very useful card. 2 AoE damage for 4 mana (including using your hero spell to ping it) vs 4 mana for CoC (1 damage and only affects 3 targets), 6 mana for Blizzard, and 7 mana for Flamestrike. If you're seeing a lot of zoo/aggro decks you might even want to run 2 sheep.

"The problem is that most accounts we've seen that start with ""Riot"" are either rioters that do not have flair permission yet or people trying to pretend to be rioters. Most of the time, people start their reddit experience here, and then branch out. So this is a rule mostly based on observation. 

Riot verification isn't done via social media. We have a contact within Riot that verifies that the person in question is a rioter and that they have been through their internal social media training.  Some rioters choose not to have flair for personal reasons as well, but they usually choose tags that do not begin with ""Riot"". Given that we get a lot of riot staff through here it helps to clear up confusion.

Drop wizards in an arc behind along with the king/queen and pekkas, then rage the both groups as they near the Air Defense so that the healers stay alive. I would take 3 rage/2 heal on this attack. Once they break into middle I would rage again. Use the heals in case the healers get distracted by the king or die. If done correctly, this should three star, but I don't think I would recommend this attack style unless you practice it first. "

"I actually liked this episode for the most part, but it still seems like they're twisting the narrative to meet plotpoints like a checklist instead of making it feel natural. 

It's like their thought process was we want Dany to meet Tyrion so let's make some fake gladiator fight that apparently it's a tradition for the queen herself to attend, and let's coincidentally bring Tyrion and Jorah there. It just all feels very forced, but that's my opinion. It's been happening all season too, like Brienne bumping into both Sansa and Arya coincidentally. Now Martin's narrative isn't entirely devoid of this stuff, for example Catelyn bumping into Tyrion in book 1/season 1 but for the most part when characters bump into each other it's less a matter of coincidence unlike the show.

Absolutely. What it doesn't mean is that you can pull stuff out of your ass with no context and say ""oh well this proves that 'the Muslims' are hateful violent extremists by default"".

"&gt; It's simply true that only Muslims seem to have this issue. 

If you try and pretend that a Salafi Jihadi or a Wahhabi is an example of your ""normal"" or average Muslim, then you're clearly not paying attention or otherwise are pushing an agenda.

No equivalent extreme subgroups exist within the boundaries of Christianity, sure. But it's the height of idiocy to say ""these groups exist because that's just the natural conclusion of evil Islam"" or some such thing. 

&gt; That's completely different from saying all Muslims do.

And as long as you make the distinction then there's not really much of a problem, unless you're actually interested in discussing the relative rise of the Salafi Jihadists as an aggressive and violent movement-- in which case, you'd have to get into a whole lot of specifics.

The problem at the basic level arises when some try to accuse or implicate the Muslim population of Texas or at the national level as being ""the same"" as the two attempted attackers or otherwise some kind of intrinsic threat."

"A cop can choose to act corrupt, just as a person (a black male in my analogy) can choose to be a criminal. So at this point we know that both sides can make a choice, okay, so this is why your last line makes absolutely no sense. If every individual in a group has to make a choice and there's evidence of at least a single individual making a different choice from another, then everyone in the group isn't the same. Convicted felons are titled convicted felons because, well, they're convicted felons. There's no generalization to be made about them being convicted felons because we're not judging off of a specific case, we're judging on the aspect of them being put into that group because of something they already did. Your last line doesn't catch what I'm trying to say at all. It's completely missing the point. It's like saying ""I'm generalizing every McDonald's worker by saying they work for McDonald's"", where in reality, I'm trying to say ""every fast food worker doesn't work at McDonald's, although a lot of them do"" (and you're still disagreeing with me, although this is purely based off of valid reasoning)."

I think its what George Orwell described as: Newspeak

*Newspeak is the fictional language in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, written by George Orwell. It is a controlled language created by the totalitarian state as a tool to limit freedom of thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, and peace. Any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct is classified as ""thoughtcrime"".*

Of course in this case one might argue that the goal is positive. That destroying the prejudice and racism trough destroying the words that represent it , is a worthy cause. But this is slippery slope and introduction of language control to make people slowly more receptive to it."

"The fallacy in making uninformed presumptions? 

That's surprising to read, coming from someone who presumed to know the intentions of the commander they just interacted with. Somehow convincing yourself that you were absolutely in the right for purposefully stealing his kills in an immature attempt at goading him into a fight.

Oh, and as a side note, telling someone to ""sit down"" or telling them they're trying to stand up without any legs, it just sounds ridiculous. Nowhere, in any of your replies to me, have you even attempted to address any of my points. ""You're making presumptions!"" is not the appropriate response to someone pointing out that you put, in plain English:

&gt;""I decided to use the massive firepower of my Class 3 cannon to do immense damage to your targets power plant, scoring me the kill shot.""

So, in that statement, you have proclaimed very clearly that you *purposefully* stole this person's kills, based on the *assumption* that he was stealing your kills on purpose. Oh, and to get back at him for engaging you *when you were wanted*. 

Do you not see how foolish that is?"

Where's an Android Wear watch that:

* quick-release watch bands
* NFC payments
* HRM sensor that actually works
* Bluetooth headphone A2DP support
* Speakerphone &lt;- lol, so high tech, where it is?
* Decent size (42mm and 36mm)
* Widgets
* mini-Widgets on the Watchface
* All day fitness tracking with accels and HRM &lt;- battery
* Officially licensed Mickey Mouse

I mean...every Android Wear watch sucks, some have 2 days batt life, so does the Apple Watch, if you don't use it at all (Apple Says), most people get 50% batt life at the end of the day, 40% with more use like fitness tracking. And making calls is not avaliable on Android Wear, because it takes too much sound amp, too much bat life.

Apple Watch shits on ANY Android Wear.

It doesn't cost $700 like MKBHD, it costs $349, and at that price point you can't match on Android Wear 4GB watches (no space left for independent music playback and etc.), it shits on Android Wear plastic (totally or parcially) watches. It's screen is the best ever in a watch (OLED and 326 dpi, unlike your MKBHD king said)

There's no way you can say Android offers competition.

Also, the Apple Watch can be purchased in luxury versions, with CURVED Sapphire glass, CURVED stainless steel that's polished, not chrome, and of course, Zirconia back. It costs $700 also because it has a dutch leather band. Can you get anything else besides $5 chinese leather bands on Android?"

"&gt; You're the one talking about self-determination and control. That is one's interest.

I was talking about the reason to give away self-determination so as not to lose it. 

&gt; That is one's interest.

If you prefer to talk about interests, most of the trade we have with Germany enters in the East, and leaves in the West shortly after. That's not real trade, you could only honestly classify the service we deliver by transporting these goods as trade. The movement itself is worthless, yet still in the statistics. 

Also Germany is a regional power, Europe is declining in every sense of the word, the future is outside of Europe, also for us, the US is a global player which makes it very important to us. 

&gt; The EU is not annexing anyone, and a small country near a giant has little influence - so the Netherlands will actually have more control over its own fate within the EU.

Certainly feels that way. It isn't our Union, we're irrelevant to the EU and that's how we are and will be treated, we will not have more control over our own fate within the EU, only less. 

If we where to leave together with the UK, we could form a political Union with Norway and the UK. Together we would be a very important energy supplier of Western Europe.  That way we can secure much more influence over the EU, while working with the US to gain influence globally."

"So we are just going to put words into my mouth? I in now way ever said it was legal, I said what the fuck do you want Israel to do unilateral withdrawal will make the PA collapse and either they will revert back to terrorism or Fatah will fall and Hamas will take over and start terrorizing Israel all over again. 

Israel has made offer after offer deal after deal Arafat's own fucking lawyer quit because he would not be reasonable and not only did Arafat not accept any deal but he refused to even lay out his own terms. Arafat never wanted a Palestinian state and neither does Abbas in fact the only group which has ever actually set out to create a Palestinian state is Hamas. Israel was the first group to offer statehood.

&gt; Conceived by the Arab states at the first Arab summit meeting, the 1964 Arab League summit (Cairo), its stated goal was the liberation of Palestine through armed struggle.[10] The original PLO Charter (issued on 28 May 1964[11]) stated that ""Palestine with its boundaries that existed at the time of the British mandate is an integral regional unit"" and sought to ""prohibit... the existence and activity"" of Zionism.[10] It also called for a right of return and self-determination for Palestinians. Palestinian statehood was not mentioned, although in 1974 the PLO called for an independent state in the territory of Mandate Palestine.[12] The group used multi-layered guerrilla tactics to attack Israel from their bases in Jordan (including the West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (Gaza Strip), and Syria.[13]

The fact is I could be a horrible person and get away with feeding my horrible urges if I didnt have DNA/Prints on file, because once DNA and prints are on file the only way to get away with sexual assualt and rape is to make sure you murder them after and fully dispose of the body, something I am not willing to do.

P.S my prints and DNA are on file because ASIO (aussie FBI) forced me to submit due to some anti-establishment ideas I had. "

However, implying we only had the season we had last year because other teams bowed out is so lazy. Falls into the line of thinking that ""tcu just can't compete week in week out in the big12"".

"Funny, I was thinking the same thing about you. 

&gt; de la Hoya and Cotto are not brawlers and would never be considered brawlers by basically any boxing fan. Most people would consider post-Freddie Roach Pacquiao a boxer-puncher as well. I honestly think you're just talking out of your ass.

If you want to make the argument that De La Hoya wasn't a pure brawler but he was an exceptional puncher at distance. Sure. I'm fine with that. But I don't know how you can say Cotto, Miguel Cotto, isn't a brawler. He likes to plant his feet and throw punches with the other fighter. (Which is exactly what De La Hoya would do) Because if we are using technical skill as a deterrent to calling a fighter a brawler, then I honestly don't know how many championship level pure-brawlers that have been around since, what, before Tyson. How many guys can brawl, successfully, without being a great technical fighter. You could say Maidana, but I wouldn't say he isn't technically sound. 

I do agree with you about Pac-Roach to some degree. Roach is a great coach and exceptional at getting the best out of his fighters (I don't know what the extent or reason he has beef with Mayweather, however) but Pacquiao is, at his core, a brawler. At will likely fight a style closer to that. I expect him to fight Floyd in a similar fashion to De La Hoya. Lots of pressure. Lots of punches. "

Personal: yes, they need to give us an ending to this story. We need to see a new the story end on a new Era away from the undead.
Unbiased: yes, this ip has yielded them their fame, from a business standpoint it should happen. is there more story wise we need wrapped up and don't know? Yes.

Just a little opinion at the end. If froms next game isn't a dark souls game (if it's a new ip) you can probably count the dark souls game out, that would show from wants to focus on other new ips.

"Why don't you chill out, McSensitive? I didn't reduce anything to anything. But sure, I'll read it again. Let me see if I understand what you're saying: because stores cater to straight couples (the overwhelming majority) that's discrimination? Because family members innocently assume that you're straight, because most people are, that's discrimination? 

Let me preempt you before you decide to try to impeach me by asserting that I'm homophobic or don't understand that discrimination against the LGBT community is very real, I am not. I'm one of the indifferent people that doesn't give a shit what someone's sexuality is. I have a few close gay male friends as a straight male. I'm also keenly aware of how discriminatory the world is toward gay people. That much is obvious and unfortunate. So, I'll ask you again: how is indifference toward someone's sexuality not promoting acceptance? 

It seems to me that you're arguing that everyone should be extremely concerned about what someone else's sexual orientation may be - that we should hesitant to market only to straight couples or ask our family members who they're dating for fear that they may be LGBT. It seems to me that you're asserting everyone needs to be more accepting by actively trying to be cognizant of the potential differences in people's sexuality in everything we do. I think that's not only unrealistic but probably counter-productive as it would seem to highlight the differences in respective groups, rather than the similarities.

It's my position that it's completely irrelevant - or should be - what someone's orientation is. What do I care? In my apathy, may I be more prone to accidentally make assumptions about people? Sure. So what? People do that all the time in an infinite variety of ways. What's it matter if it isn't malicious or potentially harmful? If it truly doesn't matter to anyone what another's orientation is, what harm is there in that anyway? Furthermore, do you sincerely expect that everyone is, or should, walk on eggshells just to avoid the incredibly likely statistical presumption of heterosexuality? Does it occur to you that bristling up at such things as someone asking about your girlfriend (provided you're male) could potential be counter-productive and unreasonably assertive?

My point is not that discrimination isn't happening or isn't a huge problem - not even close. My point(s) are that: A) indifference seems like a rough equivalent to acceptance, but I welcome you to prove me otherwise rather than just snapping and biting my head off like you did, and B) if you're asserting that the examples you listed are of ""discrimination"" that is exacerbated or symptomatic of indifference - I disagree wholeheartedly. For the most part people have a very logical and completely innocent right to assume someone is hetero. If you want to be offended by that, that seems like more of your problem than society's.

"I would argue that size directly determines efficiency. The larger the government is the more likely that inefficiencies will creep in. Part of the reason why is the desire to implement policies extremely quickly (often within the 1 election term) for political capital.

Smaller governments will lead to similar inefficiencies but they will still seem more efficient as the scope of the project/policy will typically be smaller.  "

"Well, that is the subject of quite a lot of debate, depending on how you are in regards to ""legalism"". Legalism has to do with ""following the rules"", whether they are perceived as coming from God, or coming from man/tradition. 

I have been in churches where, when a pastor was found in sin (whether sexual, habitual, or otherwise), then he was instantly stripped of his (because it is 99 percent men) pastoral duties, never to be given a pulpit again in that denomination. He is now a broken vessel, never to be used again. 

Personally, I think this is ""throwing out the baby with the bathwater"", so to speak. By that, I mean that there were probably some redeeming qualities that the pastor had, but then habitual sin crept into his life until he was trapped, whether it was intentional, or not. (The majority of the cases I am aware of, it was intentional, whether they admit to it or not). 

OK, so this next bit is somewhat subjective, and based on the circumstances, of course, and is not meant to be a blanket ""rule"". But I think what would need to happen is that, IF the leader wishes to ever be in a ministry position again, then he must subject himself to severe accountability, from a collection of elder ministers. And I mean SEVERE accountability: someone overseeing his almost every move, in real life, and on the internet. Someone who has permission to poke and peek into every corner of the offender's life. But it must be completely voluntary, and spelled out and agreed to beforehand, or else no restoration can be hoped for. 

Then after a long period (timing of course, depending on the transgression) of intense scrutiny, done in humility and accountability for one's actions, only then would he be allowed into a SUPERVISED period of ministry, again, with accountability, but perhaps slackened up somewhat (but never totally removed. After all, we have a history now). 

As I said, this has to be a completely voluntary process. If at any point either the ""accountability partners"" perceive that no progress is being made, or if there is a relapse, or any number of events, then he basically has to start over: It's an issue of building trust which has been broken. 

Of course, it can be way more complicated than that, which is why most churches that I have experienced just default to, ""kick the bum out"". But our God is a God of 2nd (and 3rd, and 490th) chances. If someone is truly repentant, then we who are mature Christians should work to restore them to using the gifts that God has given them, to the best of their abilities. 

I hope that makes sense, and I apologize if that creates more questions than I answered. 

**Edit: It sounds to me like I was misinterpreted as saying that ""pedophiles should be allowed back into children's ministries"", which is NOT what I am saying. What I am saying is that grace and forgiveness are Christian values, and that even pastors can sin. When that happens, rather than throwing them away for good, there is a process of restoring them to a ministry position. 

This guy in the story obviously is going to prison for a long, long time. I am not talking about his specific case. Rather, I am answering the question, ""In my denomination, if a pastor were to be caught in a grievous sin, how would the restoration process work (as talked about in Galatians 6)."" If you are not a Christian, it probably won't make a lot of sense to you. I apologize for any misunderstanding.**"

Now, bring on the down votes because I said that more old people and babies need to die, but the truth is that while our scientific advances have been amazing, we have failed to pay attention to the affects of these advances. We bitch about huge healthcare costs, and these are the groups that are most expensive to treat: sick babies and old people.

"&gt; Guan Yu doesn't do much damage at all. 

Guan Yu's ultimate has, by far the most base damage of any ultimates if you know what you're doing, not to mention it has a stun at the end, and he can reduce cooldowns and heal in teamfights. His kit isn't about damage in the first place, it's about being the front-liner. He shreds protections, heals, and slows. Bellona and Guan Yu are two completely different characters. Guan Yu is far more influential in the late game than Bellona if you have a good team.

Osiris is fine, his core items just need to be adjusted.

There is no viable Bellona build that doesn't build Attack Speed. If they're not building at least 2 attack speed items they're not doing enough consistent damage. She can be knocked out of Bludgeon, and the second hit can be dodged. 

&gt; Also, the current meta is stagnant in joust, conquest, and arena. 

What does that have to do with Bellona? Ah Puch is way more guilty of that, and is way more influential.

Yes, he broke the law, but absolutely nobody was hurt and a very important message was communicated.

Yo personalmente en mi comunidad pensaba votar a C's,porque todos los demas partidos son pro catalanismo en Baleares  incluido Podemos y algunos incluso independentistas ,con lo cual solo queda C's o PP y antes de que gobierne una coalicion de independentistas-socialista como ya tuvimos,tengo claro que votare PP,Ademas Bauza lo ha hecho mas o menos bien,sus problemas vienen desde la educacion,porque el  defendia el trilinguismo,cosa que los catalanistas mayoria en los centros publicos ,y siendo la UIB cuna del catalanismo no soportaban..ellos quieren 80% en catalan ,cuando aqui yo hablo mallorquin que no se parece nada a lo qiue enseñan en las escuelas que es un invento de un cientifico....El mallorquin estaba considerada lengua propia hasta que en el 59 Franco consideró que era dialecto para contentar a los catalanes..Pero teniamos gramatica desde el año 1835,y diccionario desde 1840...la gramatica catalana no aparecio  hasta 1919 ,Y para hacer su diccionario tuvieron que coger mas de 600 palabras nuestras propias de las islas...Aqui de lo que se trata es de muchos millones de dinero por parte de la generalitat al igual que en Valencia para algun dia crear los inexistentes paisos catalanes...

No tengo nada contra los catalanes, no soporto los catalanistas...se quejan de Madrid y lo que aguantamos los de Baleares y valencia es tres veces peor

 Es mas Cataluña ni existia como tal y Mallorca ya era un Reino,

Ni cultura ni nada que se le parezca nos une,hasta la bandera que usan es la del reino de Aragon..porque solo los reinos tenian bandera y  Cataluña nunca fué reino ni nada

Me parece bien que defiendan lo suyo en Cataluña pero que dejen en paz a los demas ,que llevan 30 años de adoctrinamiento en las escuelas de Baleares,y encima han logrado dividir a la sociedad Balear instaurando el mismo odio que NUNCA habia existido aqui hacia lo español

Yo soy mallorquin y no entiendo la mitad de las palabras que dice en TV3 porque tuve la suerte de no tener que estudiar Catalan..siempre he hablado mallorquin como mis abuelos,bisabuelos etc..

Y los catalanes se quejan de que con franco no podian estudiar en su idioma...pero aqui en Mallorca gracias a ellos se nos a prohibido aprender la gramatica mallorquina,Empezaron los filologos catalanes dando clases dos veces por seman una hora,y cada vez fueron aumentando mas hasta a dia de hoy que el 90% es en catalan en las aulas.Y la mayoria de padres queremos que nuestros hijos aprendan ingles ,aleman que es mucho mas necesario que el catalan,el catalan con tres horas a la semana basta y sobra...Y lo peor es ver a los camisetas verdes de Crida defendiendo el catalan en las aulas y acompañar a sus hijos a los concertados donde se estudia en ingles ,castellano y catalan a partes igules,y algunos incluso a la privada

Igual que Mas niega en la publica,pero lleva a sus hijos a un centro privado para que aprenda idiomas..¡¡que asco!!

The question is this -- does OP want to help her husband control his emotions? 

If the answer is yes -- which it should be and obviously is if she wants him to get counseling -- then just give the guy a hug. He's not asking for sex or a blowjob or something crazy, just some physical affection. 

If the answer is no, she doesn't want to help him control his emotions, then why is she even with him in the first place? "

He never really had the high profile matches outside of 1994. It's one of the more depressing things you find when watching all the old Raws and PPVs. Whether or not Owen was as good as Bret is one thing, but he definitely didn't get the opportunities to showcase his talent and most of his work is underwhelming since he spent so much of it being essentially a comedy heel."

The difference with children and animals is that they're not powerful  enough or have a developed enough intellect to be remotely responsible for what happens to them. They live within the confines of what we've created for them in the modern world. We bring children into the world and they're utterly dependent on us. We confine animals to the spaces we've relegated them to outside of our own comfort or within it when we desire so. 

Those little ducklings can't make a conscious decision to remove themselves from that location because there happens to be a psychotic Floridian who likes to hurt animals. They have no awareness or intellect to process that, and no means to relocate themselves beyond instinct even if they did.

"You fail to account for how huge the offer is, while steam does have a good hundred million of users, games never sell anywhere near close to this...

So that 1% is balanced between a lot of games. Also for a developper there is NO incentive to have you as a customer on linux rather than windows. You are still just ONE customer after all, whatever your platform of choice.

So all things accounted for, it's better to have you on windows... and quite certainly for many studios they are going even further and thing that you are an affordable loss due to the increased pain in the butt of dealing with linux support.

EDIT : I forgot another important thing... most people who are linux user already deal with the trouble of dualbooting.

Therefore they are already customers, to some degree (obviously, we don't buy all games :D). Porting your next game on linux would only make those already convinced customers to get it on a different OS. That is not worth much money, actually it costs you because now you have to port to linux, and support it as well.

Unless there are millions of people using linux that won't ever touch windows who will suddenly turn into avid gamers... well there isn't all that much extra money to make for most studios, don't you think ?"

"&gt;You realize the press is Britain is one of the most censored and heavily regulated in the Western World? I honestly feel bad about it. Freedom of the press is important, and you guys deserve it.

Thank you, foreigner, for telling me on how my country's press is. And its not. How is it censored? We have freedom of press you bellend.

&gt;Fine. Maybe you're not ""weak"", but you're barely even in the top 5. A lot, if not most, of Europe's defense budget/weapons/training/vehicles etc. comes from the U.S. So we're basically bolstering your defensive abilities.

Europe isn't part of this conversation. How is top five bad? Lmao. Besides, our military is renowned for skill in training and ability, not equipment. No, none of our military equipment is American really, bar the apache. What do you mean europe's defence budget comes from the US? Do you honestly believe that?

&gt;A person in another comment mentioned GDP numbers. If you guys are going to use an entire continent as an economy, then fine, we'll use NAFTA. The North American economy (just Canada, America, and Mexico) have a GDP of over 20 trillion dollars, 4 trillion more than the EU. GDP per capita is nearly 25% higher as well. The North American Free Trade Agreement makes up over 1/5 of the global GDP.

Who mentioned an entire continent? I didn't. I said Britain alone is 5th. 

&gt;All great influential people. Too bad the United States is still a cultural powerhouse like the world has never seen. The most recognizable brands are all American. Our flag is the most recognized in the world.

Have you ever left America? Doubt it. What goes to say your flag is the most recognised? Who would even collect that data? I'd say the British flag is just as recognised. 

&gt;We've won countless awards in literature, science, art, music, etc. - not to mention we basically own Western TV and film.

Yet Britain still has a higher rate of nobel prizes per capita.. 

&gt;It's not. Being larger means you can be more productive as a society. The Vatican City isn't an economic powerhouse because the citizens are old, it's because there's literally no resources to utilize for an economy.

Oh god you're comparing a real country to the Vatican. 

&gt;I bet you're awfully proud of that. Enslaving, torturing, dehumanizing races of people all over the world, how incredible. Also, our discussion isn't about past accomplishments, we're talking about recent history/the present.

Not particularly, just making a point reinforcing what I said about Britain's military/population.

&gt;?? It means our workers work more/harder, produce more goods and wealth, and contribute more to the global economy than yours. Whether that's a good or bad thing for our society is still up for debate, but that's for another time.

That was my point. The fact that 60 hour weeks are normal is not a good thing, it just goes to show how backwards American society can be. 

&gt;HAH. That's cute. We are the world's largest producer of coal, oil, and natural gas. The US alone has over a quarter of the world's coal reserves.

...Okay? Would you like me to praise you because your country is big enough to have a lot of resources? Would you like a sticker, maybe? Just admit it, you're wrong. You said there were no natural resources. There are. It's okay to be wrong you know?"

"&gt;Why not protest and advocate for harsher sentences to female criminals since giving them lighter sentences than male counterparts encourages the idea that women have less agency and are less responsible for their actions?

Yes, what we need is MORE people in prison for LONGER. Why would we fight to subject more people to a broken system? That makes no sense. And btw, a lot of feminists do have a problem with the prison system, especially the overrepresention of minorities, and are members of human rights organizations that seek to rectify the problem. But in the end, it's not our purview as feminists. While many feminists support various human rights issues, the primary focus of feminism are issues affecting women (shocking, I know). Personally, I'd like to see the Men's Rights movement spend more energy on men's issues such as overcrowded prisons. There's certainly some really terrible things going on.

&gt;Also, why don't feminists shit on false rape accusers since they severely undermine the system and discourage actual victims to come forward? But I guess everyone should take the woman's word at face value because. Doesn't sound like equality to me.

Feminists absolutely do shit on false rape accusers, when it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that they are in fact lying (which, unfortunately for everyone, is very hard to do). False accusers not only frequently ruin the lives of their victims, but also do a lot of harm to real victims. Coming forward after being raped is already incredibly difficult, and the stories these terrible excuses for human beings make up only make it harder, which leads to more women (and men) suffering in silence."

"70K before or after taxes? 

I make about 60K a year after taxes and 401K and insurance and stuff like that but I almost never have any money left over as savings outside of my 401K.

You really lucked out with your living arrangement - I would imagine that the average Joe will pay twice what you are currently paying for a 3 bedroom apartment in Chelsea.

By living comfortably, I mean being able to take a vacation or two a year, be able to go out a few times a week for drinks and/or dinner, and be able to save enough money that you have some sort of emergency fund. I've been working about 5 years now and I am in no position to buy an apartment in the city because there's no way I could afford the downpayment. I imagine I could pay the mortgage interest and taxes but maintenance would be $1000 or so a month which I would not be able to afford. 

I guess I could save on on food but even groceries cost a lot of money. When i was cooking at home, I was spending about $200 for 5 days worth of food. Granted I generally shop at Whole Foods but I can't imagine anywhere else being more than 20-30% cheaper. "

"&gt; Apexis Dailies:
&gt; again, the dailies are copy paste. this is less interesting and less diverse than pretty much anything we've seen since tbc.

I'm not sure that's true. I certainly feel a sense of variation when I'm summoning a gravity well as a void monster one day, and grouping up Arrakoa outcasts to save the next. It's certainly possible to burst through the dailies by slaughtering minibosses or AoEing adds, but that's not the fastest nor the most interesting way. 

&gt;oh look... one more example of highly copy pasted content. They had the opportunity to create a lot of unique encounters, but none of them are. The invasions are all practically identical and it doesn't matter to me 1 bit whether I'm fighting Goren or Iron Horde because I approach them almost exactly the same.

I'd love for this to be changed and I hope another revision of garrison invasions in a future expansion achieves it. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer has similar hoard-combat gameplay, and the category of enemy you face has a *huge* impact on strategy. 

&gt;Rares in particular have exceedingly poor return on investment and very few of them are actually worth killing even once.

True. I selected a few rares to kill - ones that dropped toys, pets or a chance at a mount - and ignored the rests. Ideally, a higher percentage of rares would be worthwhile. I didn't include suggestions for fixing them because I couldn't come up with anything realistic myself. "

"&gt;Implying that the weight gain was from a caloric surplus. Meaning a gain in fat or muscle.

Nope, implying that they didn't *lose* weight because they ate too many calories.

&gt;First, hiking will absolutely help you gain muscle.

Maybe if you do zero activity to the point that hiking is enough to achieve hypertrophy, but that's not very likely, so no, hiking will absolutely not help you gain muscle. Period.

&gt;Second, saying that he gained zero muscle mass would mean that the weight is fat

No it isn't. It could also be water weight, which is what everyone else was talking about. I was giving him diet tips, obviously.

&gt;since you claimed the weight was from caloric surplus.

I made no such claim. There you go again, being an idiot and assuming I said something.

In general, I think it's sad that there are more and more people not involved in Christianity and maybe all those people will go to hell.

"Ok.  Here we get a figure that's about 30 percent of murders are gang related.  http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6103a2.htm?mobile=nocontent

Next it's fbi statistics.  http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_10_murder_circumstances_by_relationship_2013.xls here for 2013 we have 12,500 murders approx.

In the Iraq war we have about 4500 casualties. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War

In the Afghanistan war we have about 2300 casualties http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan

We have police generated homicides at 7500 for any circumstance between 2003 and 2011 excluding 2010. http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=428

So what does this give us?  First, luckily the Iraq war started in 2003 lining up with the police statistics.  We know the police statistics but need to extrapolate a couple of years.  7500 into 8 years gives us 1000 a year rounded up.  So from 2003 until 2015 a fair guess is 13000.  Add that to 6800 war casualties total and we have say 20000 rounded up.

Now for gang related murders.  For the last statistic it was 16500 murders and approx 30% are gang related.  That's 5500 per year.  Let's round down to accommodate for possible less active years at 5000 per year.  Since 2003 that makes 65000 gang related murders.

So my original statement was off, albeit intentional, to drive the point home.  We have over 3 times as many gang murders since 2003 than the Iraq war, Afghanistan war, and police homicides combined.  We have 5 times as many gang murders than police homicides.  We have 12 times as many gang murders than Iraq war casualties.  And we have 30 times more gang murders than Afghanistan war casualties.  And this is all giving the benefit of doubt to the gang bangers while rounding.

My point still stands.  Police man shoots someone, shit goes down.  Gang members off their own community at much higher numbers, and the ""expected behavior"" is ignored.

I would like to hear the justifications for your thoughts now.

"Because muh 2nd amendmunt, muh libertea."
"I realize that, I didn't think people would interpret my statement so literally. My point still stands that RLM are just being nitpicky and there was nothing wrong with that line or it's inflection. The only reason people think it's bad is because it's ""awkward"", which really isn't a strong reason at all. This is like baneposting, people only think it's funny because someone called it out and repeated it over and over again (by repeatedly playing the clip in a plinkett review in the case of ""part time""). And I admit it doesn't help that there's a different version in the trailer. Not only would I say the ""part time"" thing isn't nearly as awkward as most people are making it out to be, I would say it's better in the movie than it is in the trailer.

First of all, I think the reason people think the trailer one is better is because in the plinkett review both versions are taken out of context. The trailer version is less bored sounding than the movie version. However, making it sound bored in the movie makes it work better. The line comes after Indy does some typical crazy Indy stuff and Mutt, surprised, says ""you're a professor!?"". If the trailer version was kept then Indy would reply ""part time"" in a completely normal neutral fashion and nobody would really bother with it. would work fine. However, the lethargic movie version has subtle implications beyond the normal version and therefore works even better, despite people getting buttmad about it. It shows a contrast between Mutt and Indy. Mutt is surprised and excited by what Indy can do, hence his question, which is really more of an exclamation. Indy on the other hand is used to this shit so it makes sense his reply is not going to be anywhere near as exciting. The fact that he sounds so bored while saying it also implies that being an adventurer, not a professor, is his ""real"" job. Let's imagine again that the trailer version was used. If Indy said ""part time"" in such a neutral way it would imply nothing outside of the fact that he is both an adventurer and a professor. It would show no preference from one to the other. It wouldn't even show if he liked them both the same or if he hated them both, it's just a totally neutral answer with a single meaning. The laziness of the movie version of ""part time"" suggests he doesn't care nearly as much about his ""part time"" job (teaching) as he does of his ""full time"" job, being an adventurer, it has multiple layers of meaning rather than the face-value meaning of the trailer version.

Same thing usually.
"And now you are making blanket statements through vague analogies.

You need to actually look at what is alleged to be offensive, and why.

So for instance; a church building is pretty innoccuous. A church that has a sign outside it saying ""unmarried women who have sex are whores and should burn in hell"" would be considered offensive. A church with a sign saying ""adulterers go to hell"" would be less offensive. Another one with a sign saying ""sex before marriage is adultry"" would probably be skirting the line between offensive and not offensive.

Now here is the thing: everyone can say and do what they want. causing offence is not a crime. I can dress up as zwarte piet, and nobody will arrest me. I can dress up as zwarte piet in the US and nobody will arrest me. 

This isn't a question of ""lets eradicate everything that is offensive"". it is a question of examining your own actions and determining whether or not you are being an asshole. If I black up in the US, I am being an asshole. If I dress up as zwarte piet here, I am not an ass. I am a friendly person who loves making kids happy.

Now even if some idiots are saying 'cancel sinterklaas, fuck zwarte piet', so what? There are idiots everywhere saying anything. It isn't up to other idiots. We still get to decide what to do and not to do with our heritage. 

It is common human decency to evaluate whether or not you are being an asshole every once in a while. Even then, you don't have to listen to other people who call you an asshole. You can just ignore them. But don't pretend like there is no merit to figuring out whether or not you are causing offence, and examining your actions when you are told you are causing offence."

Still, if someone picks Sejuani which he bought with real life money the factor of the Sejuani pick is irrelevant with how the game will outcome.

They care far less about HD vs 4K. It's hard to know if people will even notice 4K vs 8K (it will depend on screen size and seating distance, but since most people are drifting towards laptops and tablets even 4K might be too much).

If the visual difference between DVD and Bluray isn't a huge game-changer, the difference between 4K and 8K won't even be worth talking about.

I guess HFR and bitrate might be something people care about. 4K is marginal. No-one will care if they can't stream 8K."
"Its actually possible, depending on which diuretic he used and when he used it. Namely if he used lasix, since its not potassium sparing which can throw off your water retention when you DO try to rehydrate and carb up. Willing to bet he took lasix, was flat and then attempted to fix it by chugging water and crushing a high fat/high carb meal. 
But I know that flat feel...I was forced to not have a peak week just to make middleweights (not because I was fat, I was already diced to the glutes, but grew a bit into the show) and take dyazide just to make weight and TRY to fill out the day of. Needless to say I could have been much much fuller and better if I didn't have to make weight.

Moral of the story is either don't take a diuretic, or if you are, make sure you are already filled out BEFORE you take it."

"Well, yes, there's always going to be degrees of involvement. 

I wouldn't say anything about their professional lives though, I'm talking about their emotional lives. Fuck, one of the first calls I ever went to was a guy who killed himself in his garage. Multi-million dollar house, wife and two little girls. Left a good-bye note to his dog because he thought it was the only thing in his life that loved him. Goddamn that was fucked up, it was in his garage and all I could think about was how nice his cars were.

I also have an aunt who's had to go to rehab for shopping addiction. She pulls in about 750,000 a year and still had to borrow money to pay her property taxes. She has issues that result in her trying to replace affection with cash and shit for reasons, and so while that's made her driven as fuck to make money it also means she's pretty insecure and using shopping as an escape, a means to feel important and in control.

Financially and professionally successful is a long, long, long fucking way from being stable emotionally or feeling involved with people is what I'm getting at here.

I'd say that for the average person, though, once you've invested a couple of grand in a dress up animal suit (that, honestly, often look more like the sort of thing you'd find in Chuck E. Cheese. Seriously, you know that girl who dresses up like a deer? Take a hint sometimes less is more people. But that's my own personal opinion, and hey you're the one spending money) Anyways, I digress, once you've dropped a couple grand into it and start going to conventions it seems like more than just a hobby. 

And I don't mean having things like Furaffinity profiles, but when you're putting your ""Fursona"" on Grindr and Growlr it comes off as weird. I wouldn't necessarily NOT see someone because they're a furry, but putting your Fur picture up instead of your real one? Just weirds me out. Like when all the nerdy kids would make their ideal selfs as anime characters and put those on their profiles.

I talked briefly with someone else about this, it's like those guys who paint themselves in their team colours. And then you go to their house, and they have team paraphernalia all over the place. And team logo plates. And they always wear a team hat, or sometimes a Jersey going out.

Or Bears. Going to Bear conventions, getting Bear tattoos, having stuffed Bears, their entire friend group is now mostly Bears, all they talk about is their bellies and body hair, etc. etc. etc.

It's not like I've never known furries before, and I think that because you're so involved in the community your goal-posts may have shifted further than the average person for judging how involved people are in the scene. Mostly because that seems to happen with ANY special-interest group. 

And if it makes you feel better, all those special interest groups weird me out how people get sucked in like that. While I'm sure that the majority is like what you say, I'm also sure there's a loud and vocal significant minority that is way too involved, and given how fringe the interest is I wouldn't be surprised if that was larger proportionally to the fandom than in other events, as most people who would consider being ""casuals"" would probably be put off by the stigma associated with it.

And seriously. [Less is more sometimes](http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcs53w3dre1qacoxmo1_500.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.pinterest.com/tinaceresa/halloween/&amp;h=640&amp;w=480&amp;tbnid=bhcq9cMz63ZtpM:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=NSTNjFczxclrUM&amp;ei=LDFZVaemAcLxoATt34HYBg&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CEcQMygkMCQ).

Taking it off your hands is using force, you don't have to ""get physical."" It's illegal in most CIVILIZED states when a person just takes something from another's person possession, without a due proccess or calling the Police.  Guess you haven't learned that as an adult yet?  Stores actually TRAIN their employees to not take anything from the customers hand. They have to call either securit or the police. Which obviously wasn't going to be neccesary.   Obviously, this is disrespectful and illegal, bigger than the amiibo itself and can hold TRU liable.  And as customers, I am stating that The TRU staff is capable of taking things off your hands by force. Either as policy (which I doubt) or because undertrained staff.

So the value of what you're creating is  €15/h, right?

So if someone goes from being able to  €2/h to €15/h his labour will have become much more valuable, right?

the €13/h difference * many hours * many people will become a good deal of extra value created, right?

You are assuming a lot of things the first being that I eat factory farmed meat and support that industry.  And then you go right to playing the race card.  For whatever reason your cult thinks they need to have that audio loop running when they are butchering their food is a mystery to me.  It seems like a ridiculous superstition done by ignorant brainwashed cult members.  Other than that you are basically admitting that wikipedia is accurate in it's description of how an animal is alive while it's throat is slit and it bleeds to death.  Factory farmed meat is awful and inhumane for economical reasons.  Halal meat is cruel and unusual for superstitious reasons.  But you seem to be saying that one is worse than the other and at the same time implying that halal animals have a better life than non-halal animals.  The thought of letting an animal bleed to death while still alive is something you would see in a horror film.  But your cult brainwashes you to ignore that fact.  Wake up.  It's cruel and completely unnecessary.  I get my meat from John Boy's farms.   These animals have a great life AND are humanely killed. http://www.localharvest.org/john-boys-farm-M25665

"From a storyline perspective, I mean the lore and history of the profession. Even a Chronomancer is a Mesmer at it's base, and even a Dragonhunter is a Guardian at its base. Chronomancer works with the history of the Mesmer class as we know it. The Dragonhunter, however, doesn't feel (to a lot of people) like it fits in with the Guardian.

The specialization, as it exists, I think would work really well as a Warrior class. But I just think there's a disconnect between what the Guardian is supposed to be, and what the Dragonhunter is."

So if you wear half a patch, I think it's very possible that you would still get 100ug/hour for only 36 hours.

"Let's be sensible and put this into perspective with a little bit of guess work and reasoning. 

Assume a moderately short commute of 40Km. Let's say the average length of a car is 5m. Allow a car length between you and the car in front. You've just added 10m to your 40Km journey by allowing someone in front. That's 0.03% of your distance. It's really nothing. Just smile, let people in and do your own thing safely. It's not your job to police others on the road, but it is your responsibility to be courteous and defensive (not aggressive).

The distance isn't really the problem in slow-moving traffic, it's the delays caused by stopping, starting. Merging (pushing in) this way is mainly a problem because of the knock-on affect in the stopping/starting required in slow moving traffic. If possible, early merges should be used, especially if traffic is free-flowing.

It's very counter-intuitive but properly-executed zipper-merging is actually recommended in slow-moving traffic because it gets the most people through the fastest. The problem arises when half the people don't use both lanes and nobody can ""take turns"" and somebody ends up looking like or acting like your douchebags.

"Dude why does that matter. We aren't talking about a money problem. The problem is that there's no fucking water. It's not like they are piping the water into the fucking ocean. They are using it to grow food. 

(BTW farmers pay so little for water because food sales are a big benefit. It creates it's own need for infrastructure and assets like equipment and labor. This is the kind of thought that goes into these laws.)



Now with that out of the way, the food wouldn't be an issue because we import more food than we buy locally. So what we should be doing is focusing on better transportation so that they can bring in water from other states. Drive down energy costs from gasoline to compete with green energy. That will help for a while, giving us enough time to develop better methods of transporting goods. (Remember Amazon's drones?) 

Again: the problem we need to solve is regarding the lack of fucking water. "

If the Predators can send one dude on a hunting expedtion, we can capture his ship, pack it full of cobalt bombs and sterilise his home planet.

We can send drones to the nuked planets to dig up star maps and technology. 

We survived because we're the most ruthless hominid of the batch and we exterminated all the alternatives. And modern democratic societies - which survived because they're the most ruthless society of the alternatives -  take that innate human ruthlessness and add technological savvy.

And by and large the US would end up in charge in an interstellar war.

"&gt;I think what you're missing is that there is a spectrum for these definitions.

No, I'm very well versed in what the different types of capitalism and socialism are.  I'm just not sure that you know what socialism is.  

&gt;Those European countries are not capitalist countries.

Yes, they are.  Again, let's look at Norway.  They use Nordic capitalism. Nordic capitalism refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state.  

&gt;They use a very large % of their GDP for socialized programs.

Which, again, is a welfare state and not socialism.  A welfare state is a concept of government in which the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. 

&gt;See, you're being lenient with the mark of ""capitalist,"" but not ""socialist.""

To me, it is you who is not being lenient.  You are saying that these European countries, who are self described capitalist are not.  They are socialist in your mind, because you buy into the same definition of socialism as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  There are many different types of socialism such as state socialism, agrarian socialism, common ownership, etc.  Europe meets none of these.  Furthermore, given what you are describing as socialism, there are no capitalist countries in the West, but surely the United States is right?  The biggest difference between Nordic Countries and the US is that they have a larger welfare state, but both the US and Europe have welfare states.  A welfare state is independent of both economic models, as they are found and not found in both capitalism and socialism.  

&gt;Unions playing a large role in deciding where profits go is a more ""socialized"" model than when no unions exist.

Right, but ""socialized"" does not mean socialism.  Otherwise, if I had an ice cream ""social"" at work, then that would be considered socialism because it has the word ""social"" in it.  

Socialism is clearly defined as social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy.  In socialist economics, socialization is the process of structuring or restructuring an economy on a socialist basis, usually by establishing a system of production for use in place of the profit system, along with the end of the operation of the laws of capitalism. In its most developed form, the concept of socialization entails the end of money and financial valuation in the production process.  [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(economics))

&gt;A business owner can't make decisions about his business while workers strike. 

That's emphatically not true. If he decides to sell the company while workers on strike he has made a major decision.  Unions are not owners of the company.  Unions are just an organization of workers who have a common goal.    

&gt;There's also differing in definitions. See what Noam Chomsky says about political definitions like ""libertarian"" and ""anarchy,"" to see how far definitions can differ.

Everything that I have just defined in this reply is straight from wikipedia, which is referenced to economic textbooks.  If you have taken an economics class in college you would see similar definitions.  You, however have made almost every country socialist, just because you believe that social welfare is socialism which it isn't.  That's a fact, and isn't debatable.  


&gt;Fact is, a living politician called a democratic socialist is synonymous with many social democrats of Europe. Their views are very similar. Sander's views match very well with how many EU countries operate

Fact is there are democratic socialist in the EU, and lots in Nordic countries, but their countries are capitalist states.  Just like Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist in the US, which is a capitalist state.  


&gt;Sanders often advocates for the US to mimic Denmark. Maybe you can argue Sanders misrepresents himself with this label of democratic socialist. But his views are implemented in many countries.


Sanders is pushing for a larger welfare state such as the one in Denmark.  However, Denmark, is a free market economy.  NOw that we know that welfare state does not mean socialism, we aren't going to try and say that a free market economy is **not** capitalism are we?

Denmark's economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World. [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Economy)

&gt; Socialism is a complete opposite, where everyone has possession.

Now, that is a definition I can agree with, however it contradicts everything else you said.  Nordic countries do not have social ownership of the country.  Unions do not have social ownership of a company.  

&gt;Public educations is a socialized program. Socialized medicine works similarly. See definitions from wiki[1] if you want.

Socialized programs **ARE NOT** socialism.  Social programs are welfare subsidies used to help the population.  It is not social ownership of the means of production.  That is what the definition of socialism is.  Welfare, again, is not socialism.  Just because it has the word social in it does not make it socialism.  This is common knowledge that you would pick up in any economics 101 class.  I find it hilarious how some would not like the way FOX news vilifys socialism and then use the same definition for socialism themselves.  

&gt;Because we live in a democracy, this use of taxation is socialist.

No, that's wrong.  Taxation is not socialism.  This conversation is exasperating because you fail to grasp or don't want to grasp, the simple definitions of what welfare, capitalism, socialism, and taxation are.  I don't mean that to be rude, but it's like me talking to someone and them telling me that the sky is not blue, and that I am the one who is close minded, when it is obvious to anyone else that the sky is blue.  The school of economics disagrees with what you say socialism is.  The countries you say are socialist declare themselves as capitalists.  There is clearly nowhere we can move forward with in this conversation.

* France's (ruled over what is current-day North Texas from 1682 to  1804)

* Mexico's (country Texas was part of from 1821 to 1836)

* United States of America's (country Texas is part of since 1845, minus the Civil War era, below)

* Confederate States of America's (country Texas was part of from 1861 to 1865)

* Flag of Texas (self-explanatory)

Besides the Republic of the Rio Grande, there are many other native tribes (Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Coahuiltecan, Comanche, Cherokee, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa, and Wichita) and/or short-lived, self-proclaimed geo-political entities (Rio Grande, Fredonia, ""Expeditions"" sent to destabilize a newborn Mexico) which never got much recognition, and whose flags aren't being flown anywhere but where they're slightly relevant.

The only way Tyson beats Ali is if he knocks  him out.  But i just don't see Tyson knocking out Ali in his prime.

Ali has never been knocked out before and is notorious for his footwork, agility, dodging, rope-a-dope strategy and ability to take multiple heavy hits. Ali is probably the best counter against heavy powerful punchers like Tyson.

If other heavyweight legends couldn't knock Ali out, i doubt Tyson can. Ali will then win by TKO/KO after Tyson has spent all his resources for nothing OR Ali will win by UD due to his height &amp; reach allowing him to easily tag Tyson with jabs.

Fuck off. I did not ""lie""; I was attaching a different meaning to ""stock Tory response"", but clearly in your zeal you have missed that possibility. For years Iain Duncan Smith took the tack that food bank users were after free stuff and this was echoed in the Tory press. Recently Cameron waffled, in a sort of offhand way in his interview with Jeremy Paxman, about how there are a million more food bank users because Job Centres were enabled to advertise food banks. Nobody but the Tory faithful believes this argument as the food bank charities have stated publicly that most food bank users are there as a result of benefit sanctions.

"I'll do it for him:

All studies looking into actual OUTCOMES for kids raised in gay households have shown that they are far worse off than kids with heterosexual parents. Kids raised by two monogamous gay parents are worse off (statistically) than kids raised by a single straight parent.

This title article focuses on gay parents' EFFORT in parenting, but not the actual OUTCOMES for the kids -- which is what truly matters. It's shifting of the goal posts in order to paint gay parents in a positive light, because the prior meaningful inquiries returned results that go against the PC narrative."

Your country gets more than enough representation, that is the SNP or so I've inferred from your reply. You get 56 seats for roughly the same number of votes that a  Party in England would only get a seat to two. I bet you think FPTP is okay as long as it's not in Scotland, you prospered from First Past The Post and now are complaining that a majority didn't vote Tory, oh but FPTP is good in Scotland but not in England.

"To display the difference between fact and theory, a good example is when a report will state that a certain hurricane killed thousands in a particular state in America yesterday because of the reckless mass evacuation spearheaded by the local officials. In this aspect, the fact is that many were killed by the hurricane while the theory is the reason behind the death of these people. Was it only because of the haphazard evacuation plan or was it also because of the intensity of the hurricane among many other reasons? Hence, facts are really the real deal while theories are still unclear although presumed to be true.

1. Facts are observations whereas theories are the explanations to those observations.

2. Theories are vague truths or unclear facts whereas facts are really facts.

I always wanted a teacher to do was to just breathlessly rush through the entire curriculum to keep my attention without all the ancillary writing shit up on the board and asking questions. If you bombard kids with a lot of information they CANT understand they will naturally become interested out of sheer confusion. Obviously this works better for certain subjects, but I wish people would just try it.

"&gt;No, you attacked my friends...

No...they attacked me and I fought back.

&gt;Your posts sucked...if memory serves he did criticize your lack of quality and the weakness of the jokes you make in your lamer posts...

Your memory is wrong.  The only time murph explained why he didn't like my posts was after the fight with shy.  He just kept putting the gif over and over and then shy couldn't even come up with an original insult.

Before that, the only time I ever spoke to murph ever was to tell him his name reminded me of eastern Canadians.  I've also barely ever spoken to shy.  

I left them alone because that's what decent people do if they don't like someone.

My posts weren't weak.  I gave murph an explanation as to why they were relevant.  Harassing someone because you don't get the jokes or references isn't okay.

&gt;And yet you persist in not understanding why no one is taking your grievances seriously after its been explained over and over again...

It hasn't been explained.  A lot of people have made excuses that don't fit what happened.  I've heard that the repeated gifs were just like ""k"" (murph said they weren't like k). I've heard that murph gave explanations, he didn't.

All I want I want from you, death, is for you to see that following someone around being passive-aggressive and hypocritical and jumping on a bandwagon (like shy did) isn't right.  

I wasn't bothering either one of them at all.  They didn't need to go on my posts.  You didn't need to step up and defend friends who were being dicks."
I think a more reasonable expectation would be for critics to have a decent point when criticizing something.
"Its all opinions I guess. Last season he benefitted from the huge amount of space left when defenders concentrated on Sturridge and Suarez. This year he's had neither, and he's looked less of a player. Stats wise he's probably done relatively well, but he's played nearly every game, so minutes per goal etc wouldn't be all that great. Ibe and Markovic will be better players next season. Wilson, Kent, Canos and even Ojo will probably get a decent number of Europa league games to make an impression.  Add in Coutinho and even Origi playing wide when needed, and its not a position I think we lack in. 

With the pound:euro exchange rate as it is, selling in pounds and buying in euros is a relatively wise move if we can pick up similar talent elsewhere if its deemed its required if he leaves.

The other thing is its bad news to keep a player who wants to be elsewhere. It worked out with Suarez, whether Sterling would display the same will to do his best in the same circumstances I don't know.  "

"Pointing out facts about s person which may define a persons perspective is an important part of identifying bias and, finding out if they are being fair.  In our cases, I don't think that being a lesbian is nearly as relevant as you think. Her perspective as a women is probably a bigger contributing factor for her support in this. Does it make her support unfair? These ads in isolation, i don't think so.

As for male criminals and female victims, well the situations brought up happen. In these cases the men are certainly criminals in some, and in the other cases are in the wrong. And of course the women, are victims here. So I can't see why you have a problem with this fact being pointed out. 

If you pay attention to who they is talking to, it's the actually the 3rd party who can be male or female. It's not saying ""hey guys, stop raping k?"" It's saying, if you see something that's wrong, do something about it. This is really about the golden rule, this time under the spot light of sexual assault and harassment of women. Do unto others. If you were in trouble you'd want people to help too.

As a man myself, in not offended or insulted in there least and applaud the video. So I guess it's 50% of the population minus at least one guy. Perhaps because I know two women, each who were victims of separate examples brought up here it strikes more of a cord with me. But offends?! I just don't see how that could be real. Maybe I'm an outlier in terms of how much I support this. I don't say that to gain debate points, but since I am on the topic bias  may as well point out my own.

I know you're not pro-harassment of women. I know you can tell the difference from right and wrong. So instead of of saying that this anti-men and being done because we have a man hating lesbian in power I would challenge you to say something more like:

""this video does a good job of showing how we, have a major opportunity to curate our culture in a positive way! I hope the liberal party to continues this and I challenge to them also highlight gender neutral issues as well as the ones men face!""

"Wells was excellent as usual on Brady and the Pats today.  The legal standard is ""more probable than not""  and the evidence is compelling that Brady was involved in orchestrating his clubhouse servants to deflate the game balls after they had been inspected and approved by the NFL.  This issue goes back to Spygate in 2007-08 when the Patriots admitted that they violated the NFL rules and the integrity of the game and they were punished.  At that time the Commissioner warned the Patriots that if they were ever found to have been in violation of the integrity of the game again - the repercussions would be swift and severe.  So here we are 7 yrs later and once again the Patriots have been found to be in violation of the integrity of the game.  In this context Brady and Patriots have gotten off easy - they are lucky this wasn't a season long ban for Brady, Bellichik and Kraft. 

One of the things that pats fans are missing choosing to overlook is that that the refusing to fully cooperate w/an NFL investigation = conduct detrimental to the integrity of the NFL.  There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the Pats refused to fully cooperate with the investigation. For that alone there could have been punishment and sanctions.  

Brady and the Pats have mishandled this from the get go by lying and basically telling the NFL and the other 31 teams in the NFL to basically go F off w/the investigation - it has been a stupid strategy from the get go. "

It's the least timeless song I can think of, and so cheesy that Chester the Cheetah thinks they should dial it back a notch. It's completely out of place in a modern sports setting.

If the NFL had actually implemented the song, it would have fallen out of favor within 5 years as the game grew and culture changed. The NFL is marketing savvy enough to know when to cut bait on something like that."

"When I was super poor, I was terrified of going to jail, so I'd jump through hoops to make sure to never get caught or be suspicious.  We're not thief geniuses though, she probably looked suspicious at the right angle.  So yes, it's amusing and sad to see her go through so much effort and think she's so clever and sneaky.  But I totally understand her mindset.  She thinks she's covering her ass and taking no risks by being super careful (even if that's not the case).

And a box cutter is not worthless and useless when you're poor.  I used to not own scissors and was cutting things open with a bottle opener and keys.  I had nothing.  I still don't own a box cutter, actually.  She's probably not in the same position as I was, but I was also an attractive looking young girl who didn't look poor.  The reason why I spoke up against the guy accusing her of being a klepto is because I wasn't a klepto.  I didn't have an addiction.  But when I saw an opportunity to steal something easily that I wouldn't be able to justify buying for myself, I'd often take the opportunity, and that went away completely when I could afford things again.  It wasn't wise, but I was young and desperate and even a box cutter would have been worth it to me.  Even a pen, too actually.  I didn't have my own pens back then too, and my apartment was bare.  I couldn't even afford toilet paper, I'd shove napkins from taco bell in my purse.  You do what you gotta do.

She's probably a klepto though, but I have no idea.  I just felt the need to contradict that poster because not everyone has an addiction to stealing.  Sometimes free shit is just alluring on its own, no matter its value."

"EDIT:  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SCENE AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY SHOT, I'VE INCLUDED IT IN THIS COMMENT.  IF YOU WATCH THIS, IT'S MEANING IS OBVIOUS.  TOO OBVIOUS, IN FACT; WHICH IS WHY IT WAS CUT.  (THE FOLLOWING RELATES TO THE ORIGINAL OCTAVIO SCENE):

It's been suggested that this clown is a caricature of Frank Sinatra.  No way.  He's just a baggy-pants mime, and the big paper mache head is actually just a pinheaded exaggeration of the bald man wearing it (which he clearly finds demeaning:  Check out his ambivalence in even putting it on).  Basically, the whole point of the scene is just to introduce ""a good man"" to provide a bit of perspective and empathy --because there is such an abundance of lowlifes and morally vile people populating the movie.  So, with this character, we see a guy who takes a moral stand:  He hates the venue, calls out its crowd  (backstage) for the drug dealing scum they are; and he's a poor guy (*literally* pushed around by the more successful performers) who's just taking on extra work because his wife insisted; and he's even missing his daughter's birthday to do it; so he sings to her picture and kisses it in his dressing room.  And, when he's killed (becoming a narrative martyr), he dies calling out her name:  ""Belinda!!!""

But the fact is, this is a truly shitty scene in a wildly overrated movie.  It's hammy, saccharine, terribly shot, horribly acted, and obviously symbolic (Club ""Babylon,"" Jesus).  Watch it for yourself:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5bmAC0STg0

And the most unbelievable part is when the Stage Manager (who the clown had just insulted!) watches through the curtains and says with admiration as the clown takes the stage:  ""They really love him.""  Bullshit.  No crowd --and especially not *this* audience of drunken, drugged-up revelers-- would ever find this tired, empty clown schtick to be anything other than annoying."

"&gt;""But if the primary way people will choose curators by is who they already trust and follow on YouTube or whatever, what's the value of the promotion for the curator? They're already following.""

It's another growth vector, if a group of curators are considered industry wide to be the authority on good games, that will induce more viewership, on top of this the recommendations would likely cause users to discover more content creators.

Have you considered that rather than being entirely financially motivated lots of game critics want to create content that helps the consumer? with the money simply being a facilitator also through the use of this system review copies of the game and timely review embargo's would be necessitated thus enabling creators to point out what is good and bad from the outset.

&gt;This is basically the total opposite of democratizing, it's giving all the power to specific people who don't have the incentive to wield it properly.

It's not giving specific people anything, anyone can create a repository the recommendations could be more than just whats popular it could be based on values and tastes that are shared with curation groups.

&gt; The only person who could do a proper job of curating is someone who's only job is to curate

Curation is just standardized reviewing, reviewers already review stuff and as it only takes seconds to submit it to there repository I think even without any other motivations outside of doing good most would choose too.

"It sounds like they have a complicated relationship that's fragile, because everyone has to depend on the other person to keep going. The moment someone drops the ball, their whole castle collapses. The arguments with Brianna and Gloria probably happened before. 

You are not used to such family dynamics. You don't understand such family dynamics. You thought you were helping out. In reality, you indeed made things worse, because now it will take longer for them to be able to pick up the ball. 

This is not something you should rightfight about. You should apologize to the family, but don't be surprised if they won't forgive you. If you and Brianna stay together, this stuff will be regular occurance. This family has a codependence that doesn't allow the members much personal freedom. Which is why Gloria at 27 doesn't have a life of her own, but is taking care of her younger sibling(s). Your gf will follow that same way of life, because that's how their family survives: Team for everything! And they as a family are a team. You are not part of this. The family will be Brianna's priority.

So, in short: you weren't wrong about stepping in, but the police have made the situation more complicated than should've been. The officer was right that you should be gone, you were neither agressor nor victim. You completely misunderstood the situation.

"Bernie Sanders is a conspiratard. The idea that a few wealthy oligarchs control the government is just bunk nonsense. Everyone lobbies for their interest on both sides and then the decisions are made via the democratic process. We elect our leaders because we trust them to act on our behalf. Bernie Sanders just wants to stir drama over nonissues to get attention for his campaign. Bernie is an old kook who wants to punish America's large corporations for no crime other than being successful. If large corporations are not successful what does Sanders think will happen to the economy? He needs to retire and make way for Hillary, she's obviously the better choice to grow America's economy and spread our influence abroad by allowing easier access to foreign markets.  The TPP is the best way of achieving that and Hillary knows it. Bernie needs to stop with these crackpot arguments. "

"I'm not American, but if I wanted to have a gun in my country, I would have to:

* be at least 21 years of age
* be a citizen of a [EEA country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)
* be found ""reliable"" by the state. That means I have to prove that I'm not an alcohol or a drug addict, that I'm not mentally unstable, that I don't have a physical defect that would somehow impact the use of a weapon and that I don't have a criminal record.
* get a ""weapon license"". It's like a driver license for weapons (how to handle weapons, safety courses and so on).
* prove that I could store the gun in a safe place and that I'm the only person with access to it (this usually includes an inspection of the place where you want to store the weapon).
* have a reason (self-defense is a reason).

To be found mentally stable you will have to go through following tests:

* [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory)
* S-V test (a stress management test, which includes a test that shows that I even I could handle a weapon with care under severe stress)
* furthermore you could also go through these tests if necessary: [Revised NEO Personality Inventory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory), Big Five Plus One, [Beck Depression Inventory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_Depression_Inventory), [Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=cli&amp;id=overview&amp;prod=ciss), [Differential Stress Inventory HR](http://www.schuhfried.com/viennatestsystem10/tests-test-sets/all-tests-from-a-z/test/dsihr-differential-stress-inventory-hr-1/)"

"People are writing him off based on the medias character assassination, and guessing his entire political ideology from one comment on social media years ago, it's ridiculous. It's not a coincidence this social media comment has been all over right-wing media for the past few days. 

Have none of you ever made a throwaway comment that could be used against you? In your entire lives?

It's like that quote from Thick of It ""we should just clone ministers so they're born at 55 with no past"".


It's way too early to tell if anything anyone in this thread is saying is true, everyones playing the expert and summing up his entire character and political view based on very little information, saying things like ""people will see straight through him"" and ""he's not trustworthy"" is just beyond laughable.

Essentially what people are saying is the guy is rich so he must represent the rich and not care about average people, because he called some people in clubs ""trash"".. I've called c-list wannabes trash, I'm sure a lot of you have. I don't think some of you will be happy until there's a Labour leader that grew up on a council estate but at the same time worked his way up to put himself through a top uni like oxford (degrees from top Universities seem to be the pinnacle of acceptance for MPs), it's just a fantasy. 

Nobody is even objecting his views or policy decisions... Literally just character assassinations. This is why politics is so fucked, people make massive assumptions about people and figure anybody who is rich isn't to be trusted and can't possibly represent the average person. I don't distrust Cameron because he was wealthy, it's because of his policy decisions and views that clearly don't align with the average person.  "

Or someone who wanted to carry on a family tradition. All perfectly benign reasons, and I suspect all more common than the desire to bully others. 

&gt;What type of person would seek out such a position in the first place? You get a gun, 

Wow, it's not like everyone in the US can buy one of those. 

&gt;you get a license to kill,

Depends on your job in law enforcement. 

&gt;and you have immunity from virtually any and all criminal prosecutions under the sun. 

No, you don't. 

Does this sounds like a profession that's going to attract honest and trustworthy people?

You also get to bring scumbags to justice, save lives, and have some excitement in your job. All while making a decent amount of money and with good benefits. Sure there's the chance of getting shot, the certainty of getting attacked, but that's just life.

"&gt; I think that the same rules should apply to both, they should be legal, and you should be able to smoke them where you don't bother other people with your smoke.

Does that include the progressively-stronger slippery-slope campaign against tobacco?

Were you fine with tobacco use twenty years ago? Ten years? What about ten years from now when there's even more absurd laws passed with the SOLE intent of fucking with smokers for the fun of fucking with them? Would you support marijuana being treated like that over the years?

In the 90s, there was some desire amongst Democrats to outright ban tobacco. They were organizing lawsuits against cigarette companies to simply drive them out of business with ridiculous lawsuits, eventually bankrupting them (they tried the same thing with gun companies but a law got passed that put an end to it).

So I think it's rather amusing you want them 'treated the same', when tobacco has basically been getting more and more illegal over the years."

A mediocre otaku pandering comedy. As if people can make friends by becoming walking fetishes and insulting each other with boob jokes.

"I actually don't carry my passport with me all the time unless I know I am going to need it. 

A lost passport is a pain to get replaced, and I figure that is a more likely scenario than getting stopped by the police. So I always make copies and keep those in my wallet while the real passport stays in the Hotel. 

Legally you aren't supposed to do this, but my experience in Japan tells me that if I am stopped and asked to produce my passport, facing a short detention or having to go back to the hotel to retrieve it is less of a hassle than getting a new passport. "

"Sorry, perhaps I didn't articulate the ""Sanitation"" issue well enough. I understand that it's necessary for sanitation, but even soap is a sanitation issue. Both men and women have issues in public washrooms (eg: coming up with ""creative"" ways to open doors without touching the handle, sitting ON the toilet seat etc) even WITH soap, so life without soap isn't just ""dirty"" it becomes a health issue quite rapidly and diseases/infections could just be transmitted as well. That's not even considering the fact that there are reusable pads.

Now if bleeding is the issue, then all medical dressings (Bandages, gauze, etc) should also be tax free.

Personally, when I go to the grocery store, tax isn't something that I'm consistently worried about. Sure I take it into consideration, but I don't see it as a burden (which would cause me to start up a petition to get rid of it). Now for someone on welfare, it could potentially be an issue, but could you imagine the division which would be caused in the population if people on welfare were to be completely tax exempt? Just saying making exceptions is tricky and shouldn't be done just because a ""minority"" (For lack of a better word) group said so."
"This is something I've tried to work on for years, and it just added more stress to my life.  I work 60-70 hour weeks at the hospital, I'm exhausted, I don't have time to shuttle her around to playdates that she doesn't even want to go to.  My husband has the time, but he says it's not important."

"I feel the same too. All these fucking hypocrites lose their shit over the best things. If someone being fat makes you mad, you are going to have a sad life. Instead of freaking out about it why don't you just let people live their lives? If you're healthy, then why do you give a fuck? 

If fat people aren't allowed to get mad when you make fun of them, then why do you get mad when they retaliate? The stuff here irks me, but I find the comments they make are hilarious. Because I'm fat and I know it's not genetics, I'm just lazy, and you know what. Maybe I don't mind the way I look with the weight. I've never attempted to blame it on anything, but the fact that I've never tried to do something about it. 

I was a stick as a child and I hated it. I was tired of being frail looking. I'm not saying I'm the preferred shape for a women, but at least I know looking this way weeds out you shallow fuckers. Not all fat people are rude or disgusting. Sure it shows a lack of self control, but that's just a flaw and everybody has those. Even you shitlords. 

And try to call me unintelligent all you want, but I think my IQ test begs to differ. "
"While this is mostly true. People do gain and lose differently. Some people can eat 5000 calories a day and gain 40 lbs in a couple months while someone else might only gain 10 lbs in that time. I made up these numbers of course but the point is that this business about body types gets misconstrued. Yes people will gain and loose weight differently, and some people would really have to work to gain it, but I firmly believe that if you eat a healthy balanced diet, you wont have any problems, and you will be able to find a diet that works for you. Op is right, at some point your body would need more energy no matter what and you will loose weight.

"There is $260 in the pot before the $150....so going over the top with aces wouldn't be a terrible move as you are priced in. If villain was straight to your left, I would imagine him on J 10 or with pocket 8s. Seems strange he would re raise with 3 more behind him. Doubt he would re raise with J 10 most of the time with callers behind him.

That's a great flop for aces. I think your mistake on this hand was not to re raise him on the flop."

"I'm going to point out one example of a bogus argument and then I'll let you get the last word because this is getting old. 

&gt; The ""polls"" are done by people who don't follow the NFL, /r/nfl is only people who follow the NFL....

If ESPN does a poll, why do you automatically think that it's not of NFL fans and why do you put in in quotes, as if your pivot-table statistical analysis is more legitimate? More than likely, it's a self-selected group of NFL fans. Why else would someone take the time to take the poll?

"Your statement is stunningly sexist. Let me explain something to you:

I mop my own floors, vacuum my own rugs, iron my own shirts, pay my own bills, balance my own checkbook, and cook well enough to make a foodie blush. *I do not need a ""Cool Girl"" to make my life complete. I do not need a ""Bitch Wife"" to make turn me into a responsible adult.* And likewise, my male friends and associates don't either.

"I dismiss arguments that I have already considered and found flawed.

I am sorry if you think it's arrogance when I don't pretend that I am coming to this idea for the first time.  

Stop whining about my attitude and try to generate a non ad hominem argument.

Continuity, in the context of this discussion of the physical substrate underpinning our consciousness, is an illusion.

I reiterate that if you have not noticed that yet. Its is because you have not spent time dispassionately considering the mater. If you feel that lack of experience is the same thing as being accused of stupidity then you are only getting worked up about your own issues.

Even your supposed dilemma reflects your inexperience, it sounds at first glance to be difficult but only because you are looking at it from the outside. I offer you the same chance as I did the fellow I replied to originally.

Define this ""me"" that you are so protective of. Stop being vague and hand wavy.  Define exactly why you say it won't work.

"Here's another perspective.

When we pass judgment, we are telling the world that the punishment we use is jus. How can we say that murder is wrong, if we use murder ourselves?

No murders are okay. The murders that Tsarnaev committed were not okay, and our murder of Tsarnaev is not okay."

"The integration is a big part of it indeed. It's not that I don't like federations alltogether, it's just that I do not like many cultures in Europe. I mean I do like them - but not in my everyday life if you understand what I mean. I like the French when I visit them, but when I leave I want to return home. 

I don't like the extremely chauvenistic side of the French for more than a 3 week holiday, not in my everyday day life. I don't like the huge German extreme left, and I don't like the Spanish and Greek 'manána manána'. 

I like them all when I visit them, I love to meet new people in foreign countries exchange idea's and experiences, but not to live among each other 24/7 365 1/4 days a year, at least not there. There are countries I could spend a good portion of my life, just not any and all.

So I want to live in a country that makes its own decisions, it's own ideas, and we're small, we're efficient, we're liberal and progressive, we can implement things fast, try things out as the first. Yet we're all drawn into this sluggish bureaucratic monster impeding any local progress, tying us all together in chains  ""because we would otherwise fight each other"", yeah right. 

Yet this is exactly where we have a nationstate for. We want to make things better, more efficient, coherent, modern, we don't need Brussels for that. What the hell does Brussels know about us, and what do I care what somebody in Hungary thinks of our ideas?

So I don't like a European federation, or much of anything that is in between. And the further I see our national institutions wither away, decisions, fines and ideas forced upon us by aristocrats and larger states, the more I want to leave this place. 

I also don't like the mass immigration, and yet this is another subject where the EU can never agree or achieve anything, and it will not be solved, and when it will, it will not be solved in a way the Dutch want it, while the reality is that a huge amount of them come exactly here. 

But I take my defeat when it is time, there are more people living here and we all have the right to our opinion, vote and view, and if this is what they want to move towards, then I will leave eventually.

But I'm not in a hurry, just finishing up my papers, and I'll need a couple years experience in my branche before becoming any worthwhile asset on the labour market, and then I'll see where we are. "

"Man, you didn't deserve that.

Nobody deserves to die for what they did, they deserve to think about what they did, hence why there is such thing as a prison. Somebody once told me, the biggest thing he lost in prison was part of his life going to waste, which was the biggest punishment he could imagine, which I somehow really could understand. And for people who don't seem to understand what they did wrong, they get life sentence. Don't know a whole lot more on the regard, but at least I personally believe so. "

"&gt;He was simply able to find the planet when the remnants of Freeza's army couldn't.

&gt;he was able to do something they weren't.

Which makes this a HUGE discrepancy since Tarble didn't have any more advanced technology than the new Frieza army. In fact, it isn't stated anywhere that Tarble's technology is any different than the technology on Namek from way back then. So by default, Tarble has the same outdated technology from way back then.

Meanwhile, Frieza's remnants stated their technology is more advanced and they still couldn't find New Namek.

Since Tarble somehow finding this planet that a large group of people with more advanced technology couldn't do so, we can chalk it up to another inconsistency/discrepancy in ROF.

Along with Cold somehow inexplicably knowing of Beerus and Boo, but STILL stating that if Goku is dead, the greatest power in the universe would be in His &amp; Frieza's clan, and of course Frieza not training to rematch Goku in the Trunks saga, all of which has fan rationalization but no official explanation. Hell ROF has already as much plot holes as GT does.

"""obvious lack of paradise after death""

You made the claim.  Prove it.

""To me, it would be the condonement of atrocities and oppression that I not only allowed, but encouraged, in the name of my god.""

Your statement is flawed as you assume believers condone and encourage whatever these unnamed atrocities and acts of oppression are.

Even if there are 1 million radical Muslim terrorists that still leaves 999 million non radical Muslims who do not condone their actions.  (Im not a Muslim btw)

""Yeah, for me, it would be a hard pill to swallow to realize I had spent my life emotionally apathetic and void of any personal growth.""

Really?


IF you believe there is no ""God"" then there is no ""plan"". Therefore there is no ""fate"", and nothing is/was ever ""ment"" to be. 

Evolution tells us we are here because of trillions of random events resulted in you being born. 

To the Universe we are no better than your dog, cat, or the insects. Your life and death have No meaning and you will be forgotten along with the billions of humans that came before you.

Under the atheist viewpoint our lives have NO meaning and purpose. If life on earth ends tomorrow or 5 Million years from now, our lives mean nothing greater or less than the life of a grasshopper or snake.

Atheists believe when you are dead there is nothing. 

Therefore when all life is gone on earth there is nothing. 

All that was, has become nothing.

So what type of meaning and purpose do you think your life can actually have if the atheist viewpoint is correct?

My point was that for those people who expected a slug fest (which no one should have been expecting) they will continue to be disappointed by boxing and that the sport probably isn't for those people. Nothing wrong with that, everyone loves a war but it's doesn't happen all of the time and if you can't appreciate all facets of the sport then it'll only frustrate on night like last night.

"That doesn't answer my question though: if a gay couple are having dinner one evening and decide to get married, the next day they start planning the wedding, a month later they get ready for the wedding; at what point is *your* personal blessing relevant to their marriage? At what point do you enter the situation? Why do they need to go to you at some stage during this for your permission? 

I just want one person to tell me at what point during the process of planning the wedding their approval is relevant to the gay couple and why they think they should be the one who decides whether the gay couple can get married "

You have money to waste and you chose this hobby. However your neighbor might farm full time and could have used that land to expand, or you have the next generation of farmers coming up who can't get into land unless its a family farm because ""hobby"" farmers like yourselves have driven the price up so high.

But no one can tell you what to do, your money, your land that is the most important. "

"Well two of my first girlfriends asked me out and it kinda worked since they became my gfs obviously. Here is what worked for them:

1. They were really confident and exciting and bubbly.

2. They were attractive (obviously). At least try to look the best you possibly can that can emphasize the energy you are emanating. For me what makes a girl even more beautiful is her natural looks plus the effort she put into her looking good and the effort she put into the conversation.

3. They were giving me a lot of intense/cute looks and smiling before talking to me. 

4. They talked to my friends first and talked to me while talking to them. i then sibconciously separated myself from the group and they amazingly realized it was their chance to talk to me alone.

P.S. guys who dont approach are either pussies (like i was) or just not interested. "
"No, I rather Mayweather fight back, block, and dodge when he get cornered. The fact that you can get away from someone beating the shit out of you by hugging them out until the ref separates you is straight up retarded. Either let the guy getting clenched keep hitting or penalize the guy doing the clenching.

&gt; Mayweather threw more punches over the course of the fight than Pacquiao and landed a higher percentage of them.

Almost all them were counter punches or soft jabs. Pacquiao wasn't even swollen. Neither fighter got beat up, they could have gone another 12 rounds. The highlight reel of hard connecting punches for the fight was just pathetic.

This ""fight"" proved that boxing will not be taken seriously again for decades unless they make some major changes."

"I, of course, recognize both the real and the common definitions of all those words.

What I said is still true. Atheists^1 co-opt agnostics^2 in order to be able to accuse non-atheists^3 of the No True Scotsman fallacy when the non-atheist rightfully argues that an atheist does indeed have a belief and therefore atheism is a religion. The atheists that include agnostics in the definition will say that atheists include agnostics and therefore not all atheists have that belief. When the non-atheist points out that atheists and agnostics are different, the atheist will use a No-True-Scotsman style argument to say that the non-atheist is wrong to define atheism that way.

Also, the definition of *religion* does not require a belief *in a deity*, it merely requires *beliefs* that are either unsupported by science or that the believer does not regard whether or not they are supported by science.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion

&gt;religion  
a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith

So, as explained by the definition, if you hold to with ardor and faith the *belief* that there is no god, that is a religion.

^1 by the common definition, i.e. those who believe there is no god  
^2 by the common definition, i.e. those who believe it has not been proven that there is or is no god  
^3 such as but not limited to Christians, Islamics, and non-atheist agnostics"

"If the empire does something stupid like sending their star destroyers into the middle of the map, then yes, the rebels can flank them and win.  The smart thing for the empire to do though is take a couple of victory classes, keep them parked on the side of the map with their front arcs covering everything, and then wait for the rebels to come into range.  They have enough shields and hull that they can take a beating without defense tokens long enough to destroy anything that comes in range, and then use a few engineering commands/tokens to heal up again.  The rebels will have a hard time hitting them without either exposing themselves to massive damage or flying off the edge of the map.  Heck, the empire player can just wait for when it looks like the rebels are about to move in, use a maneuver token to speed up to 1 for a turn to get those defense tokens, and they will basically be unscathed while destroying every last rebel ship.  Two Victories is enough to handle that, and then just fill the area around them with TIEs to keep any bombers at bay.  Doing this you should be able to keep your fleet points down low enough that you will be able to dictate initiative/objectives in such a way that you can force a win like this."

"Hair is purposeful and functional as well. 

""Humans, horses, and orangutangs are among the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are believed to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).""

"Both have their features. Both have their goods and bads. The Evo is more of a purest car and there isn't much for easy living on it. Interior isn't the greatest, but the driving feel is fantastic.

The EJ257 hasn't really been updated and you get newer tech out of the EVOs engine, but even that is dated at this point. The 4B11 hasn't really changed since 2008 either.

"&gt;If anything, the general opinion is that Sony fucked up by denying it. 

and this general opinion doesn't have any of the facts. we have no idea what ea wanted sony to do in order to get ea access on the playstation.

for all we know, they could have wanted a substantial amount of money from sony, they could have been demanding significant changes to how psn's store/authentication works, they literally could have been asking for anything.

&gt;In fact, if I paid yearly, I'd be paying a 3rd less than one retail game, for about 7 full games,

not exactly. don't forget, you are getting games roughly a year after they are released, and many of them are sports games. by the time that the games get added to the service, they can typically be found for $20 or less. the best games are also nowhere to be seen, with some of them explicitly saying they won't be on the service such as titanfall.

additionally, ea reserves the right to remove access to any game for any reason at any time. they say they don't plan on using that ability, but they can at any time.

&gt;You have no idea what you're even talking about. I'd happily accept more of EA access types service. It's the equivalent of saying Netflix is bad because films are on subscription lol. 

actually, he has a valid point. netflix works because it's 1 subscription for everything. you subscribe to netflix, you don't subscribe to sony's video rental service, disney's rental service, warner bros's rental service, and each other studio separately. this is more akin to the ea acces model where as netflix is more like ps+'s igc or xbl's gwg.

"Are you seriously incapable of understanding subtlety?

&gt;How do you draw the line between exploring their sexuality and being objectified?

Porn is mostly objectification. [These are examples of objectification in comics.](http://bdb3b8.medialib.glogster.com/thumbnails/58773a3a7d9da0cb177d39cfde09dc3f18077ba7bf08379f73a03b7565dd95f4/the-male-gaze-source.jpg) [Here are more.](https://www.google.com/search?q=male+gaze&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ahtKVYiTBMTAggS9-YK4Cg&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1239&amp;bih=799#rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=objectification+of+women+examples&amp;revid=256333189) Objectification is when a body is framed like an object. Is that hard to understand?

An example of sexuality not being objectified is a certain sex scene in Inherent Vice, if you've seen that. Actually that film might be useful for understanding the distinction of a film objectifying a movie and characters exploring sexuality. Earlier, sex is sold as a product, but the women are entirely in control, and the film refrains from framing the sex as an object, and it doesn't at all push the idea that women are objects.

&gt;How is this different from slut shaming?

"I've already stated in a couple other posts I understand safety for the police. My issue is with the logic.

I've also mentioned I would totally agree with their response, had the guy been forcibly detained.

He was there of his own accord, serving a court sentence. He had already paid his fine so he wouldn't have to spend an extra day confined. He was going to be there literally until the next morning. To hide a weapon, then injure himself in order to lure and injure officers.. something that could only elongate his stay...

Someone sane wouldn't do this, he was acting normally before the blood showed. Then as far as they know he was actively bleeding and unresponsive to verbal stimuli. You say that constitutes unstable? I've seen unstable, a typical subject not responding to questions isn't unstable by itself.. it's cause for concern. But someone staying overnight who has cooperated entirely up until this point, all of a sudden becoming completely unresponsive to speech.. soooo tactical extraction time? They started with a crawl (officer outside talking nicely.) Then skipped to a run (full team rushing into cell and throwing him on his back.) The dude looked confused as hell, no resistance, just yelling, ""I CAN'T BREATHE."" Surely there was an intermediate level of response.

He was going to be out literally the next morning. He was already in trouble with his command for having a DUI in the first place- doing something even more stupid while serving his sentence would only fuck up his career much much more. He at no point resisted in anyway, except saying that he can't breathe, which seemed to be the only thing he could say- maybe because he wasn't fully alert to what was going on around him. You could see in his eyes that there's something more than deviance at work in that guys mind. He was in a state of shock, and they acted like monkeys at a keyboard, just hoping eventually whatever dumb shit they tried would eventually make their mistake better.

I respect law enforcement, I really really do- but an otherwise healthy, active duty soldier died here and I have a hard time believing it was anything other than negligence and excessive use of force.

And then takes from the poor, more than it takes from from the rich (relative to their income). It's a circular argument you're making here. Benefits are supposed to benefit those who are down on their luck. Taxes are supposed to take more from those that can contribute more. The first thing is happening, the second isn't.

This is [demonstrably false.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films)

"&gt; Because ""creative property"" isn't a thing

It most certainly is. How is this the same subreddit that derides artists for copying others, yet supports this entitled-idea that people don't own their own creative ideas?

&gt; If you only had the rights to such a story for 30 years instead of 90, would there be such a huge drop-off in creativity that it would outweigh the gains from putting decades worth of culture into the public domain?

What's a better incentive - owning it for 30 years or 90?

"Having a ""certain mindset"" but doing absolutely nothing to oppose the patriarchal nature of society isn't exactly painting you in a great light.

Lets try a few simple questions about ways you can show solidarity with women.

1) Do you consume cultural products produced by women (e.g. movies, books, computer games, anything else that a women may have made?)

2) Do you challenge someone who posts something that is sexist online? Additionally, when a women tells you something is sexist do you believe her?

3) Can you name one hero or role model that is a woman? 

4) If a male friend is doing something sexist or harmful to his female partner do you say something to your friend about this?

5) Outside of marriage and family how many female friends do you have?

6) Do you police women's appearance (either directly to her or behind her back?)

7) Given that women earn less than men, do you donate a portion of your income to social justice causes to help make up for that difference?

8) Do you refuse to consume porn, girly mags, etc and avoid strip joints and prostitutes?"

"Yes, it is a sin. You cannot serve yourself. Suicide is selfish. You remove all power from God when you commit suicide. Everything He was going to use you for in life is now gone and impossible. Disarming God is a direct attack on Him. You become His enemy. You work your own will, and neglect His. This is the truth.

Stop thinking entirely of yourself, and how life owes you. You are a worker of the field for His pleasure, and that's it. This is the life you chose, so live it. Start being a little more receptive to what He wants of you instead of being so bottled up in yourself.

You have already changed the world by becoming Christian. If even a little bit of you has changed due to desiring to please God, then the old man has died, and a new creature is made. He who started a good work in you shall perfect it. You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you. You are seated in Heavenly places with Christ.

We fight against not flesh and blood, but the powers, principalities, and spiritual forces of wickedness who seek to make the straight ways of the LORD crooked and filled with stumbling blocks. Your mindset is of the devil, and I urge you to pray on the full armor of God every day. Gird your loins in Truth, put on the breastplate of Righteousness, shod your feet in the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace, wear the helmet of Salvation, take up the shield of Faith, wield the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God, and clothe yourself in Christ... asking for a hedge of protection, a shield of fire, a ring of light, and plead the blood of Christ over yourself, your family, your household, and your church family.

Finally, wearing the armor of God, pray to bind the demonic forces that may be implanting these dangerous thoughts and intentions into your spirit and mind. Cast them at Jesus' feet and ask Him to judge them. Also pray to loose the spiritual spells against which you have been ensnared, and cut the ropes of the webs of deception. Give thanks to your Father in Heaven because He protects you more than you have mind to understand. Prepare yourself daily because you are on the enemy's radar now. And your enemy never forgets a face.

It's your choice now whether or not you want to suit up, and really work the field. This sub doesn't know shit about the spiritual war. As far as I've seen, they are a bunch of toddlers bickering about the most inconsequential things, and totally blind to the real deceptions. I never come here, but for some reason I am here, and I am talking to you. Spare me the replies. I am not here to debate anyone. I also certainly do not want to be brought to this sub again. You are all far too lost in self."

"You realize these Stormfront copypasta's are made purely to show that their racism is based on statistical facts that prove their point of view. 

These copy pastes are made to look like an in depth statistical analysis, but they are a collection of cherry picked data used with no context.

For example, poor black populations tend to be in highly dense urban areas. Poor white people tend to spread out in rural communities. Comparing one population to the other without considering the numerous variables is pointless.

Something these copy pastes won't tell you is that crime rates across different urban communities with high black populations should match up if their racist point of view was correct. This of course is not the case. This is because there are numerous factors that go into crime rates.

We know crime rates are a reflection of many environmental factors and that two communities with similar demographics can have widely different crime rates. These copy pastes pretend that none of the countless factors make a difference and that skin colour is what really matters. Hell, these copy pastes ignore a large factor and that is the police force. Stats come from arrests and we know that blacks get arrested for drug related crimes at much higher rates than whites even though there is no difference in actual drug related activities.

They will then concede to a new series of rules and regulations, paperwork and 'red tape' required and again full-support even from the working poor and everyone else.

Of course, we ought to be concerned but almost nobody looks at the terrible sometimes devastating downsides when your nephew wants to paint fences one Summer. Or your Uncle now realizes his pressure-washing truck is - for all red-tape reasons - no longer worth doing this year.

"Are we agreed that killing in self-defence is not murder? We have it as the law in our society that it is not. It isn't even criminal. It is perfectly just and lawful behaviour.

Are we also agreed that if I shoot and miss and accidentally kill an innocent, that is also not murder? A tragic accident, wrong place at the wrong time and all that, but not murder? My action was still self-defence, but the villain of the story dodged or ducked, or my aim in this moment of terror was inexact, and some poor passerby was slain. That's no crime on my part.

Because if so, then we have agreed on a policy under which, in certain circumstances, it is no crime to kill. And we have agreed that despite the risk that innocents will be slain from time to time, still this policy should stand.

I think this has some applicability to the argument on capital punishment. You've agreed that the law may name certain circumstances in which killing is acceptable. You've agreed that this is so even if there is a possibility that innocents may inadvertently be slain. So what becomes of your argument that capital punishment is murder?"

It's analogy to slavery in 19th century Southern US.

&gt;Yes I did. We value human life over business profit.

That doesn't actually mean what you think it does.

Profit means efficiently using resources according to those consuming and producing them.

Further human life isn't *infinitely* valuable. If it was, then that tells you right there why costs skyrocket: you value it with no limit.

&gt;First of all profit motive existed as long as we have understood the concept of 'more food = better, less food = worse'. Second what is your point? That profiting sometimes also helps people? I am not/have not pretended otherwise.

So it's not as simple as profits&gt;life. They aren't completely separable because they overlap.

&gt;The government takes their rightful property back.

Rightful property? When did they own it?

&gt;No, you obviously dont understand either rights or priorities. Positive, negative, doesn't matter. One persons business/religious/whatever rights do not trump others rights to life. Life and safety rights trumps wealth building rights. Because life is worth more than wealth. Because wealth means nothing without life. 

No you really don't understand. A positive right is an obligation to action; a negative is an obligation to inaction. They are *very* different.

&gt; One persons business/religious/whatever rights do not trump others rights to life.

"Indeed all crime has been falling for decades.  The study basically shows that crime in a few specific areas (notably aggravated assault) has not fallen as far in areas that have introduced Right to Carry laws as opposed to those that did now. Let's also keep in mind that part of the justification of RTC laws is that allowing 'good guys' to carry guns reduces crime; there's no statistical evidence to support that.  On the contrary, without RTC there would be fewer aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies.

Yesterday's report on crime in Florida would seem to confirm these findings.  Crime overall is down, with notable exceptions for murder, rape, and aggravated assault which are all up.  How can this be explained?

I don't have access to the full text of the article so I can't walk you through the numbers.  The abstract for the study can be found here:

"To get an animal companion like that, the Oracle will devote only 3-4 feats and it's favored class bonus, some gold is nice too. 

Since it's companion has Spell Resistance, it can throw a trait and a feat into Will and be pretty well off. 

The Oracle's Animal Companion will have 7 natural attacks at level 12, and pounce, flight, spell resistance, grab, energy resistance, damage resistance, etc. The Oracle also has access to some awesome buff spells like Atavism and Animal Growth. 

The Oracle is also a NINTH level caster with the entire cleric spell list.

The Hunter's companion is broken in a different way, but I'm a bit too lazy to lay it all out for you.

For the Oracle: 

1. Be an Aasimar
2. Be an Oracle (Nature)
3. Take Sacred Servant, Monstrous Mount, Spirit's Gift, and Evolved Companion (Tail Spike) (Optional)
4. Buy your Animal Companion a Helm of the Mammoth Lord

"&gt;What Palestinians are still being displaced? Settlements aren't kicking anyone out. Nobody is leaving their homes in the WB because of Israel.

See another issue (from what I noticed) is that Israelis will then even deny what is currently happening to Palestinians or clearly announce their ignorance. 

As OCHA oPt explains there are thousands of forced displacement of Palestinians by the Israeli authorities. For convenience let's just ignore the some 500,000 Gazans that were displaced over the summer in 2014, and the 100,000 as of December that continue to be displaced. It seems you're strictly speaking about the West Bank and settlements. So in 2014 alone there were hundreds of house demolitions in **area C of the West Bank** and the displacement of close to 1,000 Palestinians (let me say it again: within area C).  Every year before that hinders the same outcome - more and more displacement. According to OCHA oPt, for 2014 there was a 20% increase in displacement in area C. Moreover, area C which consists of 60% of the West Bank; 99% is off limits to Palestinians and is only for expanding illegal Jewish-only colonies. 

Moreover, there are some 7,500 Palestinians at risk of displacement due to Israel's ""relocation plans"" to destroy these 46 Palestinian communities in the central of the West Bank. Just like the white colonists in America ""relocated"" the native Americans. 

Further, there are some 38 Palestinian communities in the West Bank facing displacement due to Israel wanting the land for military training. That's some 6,200 more Palestinians. In 2014 these Israeli military training sites lead to the displacement of 1,277 Palestinians. 

There are also constant evictions and demolitions inside East Jerusalem. This lead to the displacement of a further 208 Palestinians in 2014. 

Imagine if Palestinians displaced thousands of Israelis annually. They couldn't fathom it and would declare another Gaza bombardment immediately. 

&gt;I deny the Nakba day because it's based on hate.

That doesn't make the Nakba any less legitimate or real. 

Moreover, it's not based on hate. That is your diluted interpretation. The Nakba is remembering the dispossession of the Palestinians and the destruction of hundreds of their communities by the hands of the Zionists. It is a day to further remember the current trends of Israeli colonization and displacement of Palestinians. 

It is a day to recognize Israeli denial.

Like I said, everybody has their justifications.

&gt;Knowing that united Arab armies converged on Israel in an attempt to kill off the Jews

""To kill off the Jews""? That's not even historically accurate. All the Arab armies went in to the war with different intent. Jordan and the Israelis made a deal to allow Jordanian annexation of parts of the West Bank. Egyptian army movements were to prevent Jordanian land grabs. Most the fighting occurred within the Palestinian designated area for a state under the partition. And no Arab armies joined the war until after 200,000 to 300,000 Palestinians were already displaced by the Zionists.

&gt;I would like to say that the Holocaust was much worse than the Nakba and that it's offensive to compare the two. 

They're two separate occurrences in history. You compared them, not me. I told you how stupid the comparison was in the first place.

Administration of the camp at Płaszów was turned over to SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Goeth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945""

"I have zero problem with torrenting because there is actually a high percentage of distributed p2p traffic that is legitimate — it's an excellent way to distribute large images such as games and patches. It's a legitimate technology.

I'm not saying that NSFW subreddits that may potentially and unknowingly … that's far too large a burden, with far too much of a chilling effect. People need to have an articulable reason to suspect they're going to receive child porn, are soliciting known child porn in general or in specific.

The mods on NSFW subreddits that deal with the child porn — they're not at that position explicitly to get the child porn, and the actions they take to remove and report child porn demonstrates their intent. 

If they *reasonably believe* that continuing the operation of the subreddit is going to result in them having to filter child porn because the subreddit is explicilty soliciting the child porn, they have a duty to shut the subreddit down. If they have a good faith reasonable belief (have reason to believe, an articulable reason) that the subreddit is soliciting and distributing solely stolen property, they have a duty to shut it down. That reasonable belief came from law enforcement representations that the traffic targeted by the fappening was all stolen."

I already suggested a ways to achieve that kind of ballance months ago, but most of the players (i think, all those who play in big groups) downvoted me. I even had a perfect solution of a tool, that could affect ONLY big groups of players, but... nobody listens. "

Perhaps create your own opinion instead of blindly following that of what you see on streams or whatever.

The A4 is also more concealed behind tight corners allowing you to get the drop on 1-2 enemies atleast (if they do not check where you are). A1 and A4 can be sprayed just as accurately if you have a skilled player using both. So please tell me, how is ""A1 simply a more effective gun for killing people"".

"I'm all for the abolishment of the white race. Look this guy is a white male calling for it, and obviously hes not calling for the extermination of any individual white people, hes not suicidal.

Look this little 16 year old white girl wrote to him, asking why hes being so mean to her, when shes never done anything wrong, just because shes white. And once the White Male abolitionist explained himself to her, she was totally ok with it.

&gt;Thank you for your explanation. I see what you mean, and I am sorry I jumped to conclusions.

A White Nationalist considers anyone who race-mixes to be a race traitor, although they are much, much, much harder on white women than white men. But if a white man wants to racemix, thats exactly what he has to be a true race traitor. Someone who is willing to put the interests of his colored son, above that of his own race. Sadly, I don't see any WMAF couples stepping up to the plate on this. 

Some white guys married to Black women, are actually very progressive and supportive of black causes. So I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with white men and colored women.

No, gender is not a social construct. Gender is a biological construct based on your reproductive capabilities and the chromosomes you carry. It is that simple, unlike some complex animals who change their genders completely, we don't. Until you change that DNA structure, you are and always will be the gender you were born with.

"Please read:
""The first handheld mobile cell phone was demonstrated by Motorola in 1973. The first commercial automated cellular network was launched in Japan by NTT in 1979. In 1981, this was followed by the simultaneous launch of the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.[7] Several other countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s. These first generatiion (""1G"") systems could support far more simultaneous calls, but still used analog technology.""

WWW did to Internet what Ford did to cars, made them truely useful tools. Internet pre www was not commercially significant. Most people wasn't even aware of it.

Yes I'm aware of internet's structure, but my angle was more humane than yours. End users experience is really everything that matters. What happens under the hood is not important in the big picture. We have billions of people connected now. Nor does ARPANET make Internet... These things together make internet. Yea DARPA had their network, that's pretty common knoweledge. The concept of today's internet is so much more complicated than that though. 

Originated from an American invention yes, but as you stated it's the sum of it's parts.

America has contributed a lot more than what Jeremy Clarkson claims :) Just wanted to explain that technology  nowadays is always an application of some earlier invention. Chinese invented rockets but Americans flew to moon and build ICBMs... Transistor I give you, but computer isn't American eihter... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#History

That's the problem, though. I'm pointing out one way the word mistake is commonly used by others. Like words can have different meanings or different nuances behind them. I'm pointing out one way the word ""mistake"" is used that doesn't align to your description of it.

Well, I didn't mean to imply that just because someone looks like they've changed you shouldn't take safety precautions.

"But this isn't an effort we're making, in this case we are actively making an effort to prevent this guy from improving his own living conditions, I'm assuming here that the guy is having his family provide the playstation. It would actually be easier for them to let the playstation in, but instead they are going out of their way to make things worse for him, and I think that's sad. As for sending a message, go out and ask some people what they think. Try to find somebody who's been to prison for 2-5 years and ask them what they thought of the place. Ask them if they enjoy the meals, and the regimen. Ask them if they enjoy working at gunpoint. Ask them if they enjoy the staff who work there. Ask them what they would do to keep from going back. 

Now find someone who's poor, and never been to prison. Ask them about their relatives and friends. Ask them if they think that life in prison might be better than life out on the streets. 

I'm sorry, but I don't think that ""deterrence"" comes even close to a serious argument given the state of prisons in the US right now."
"You know, it's funny because, it really isn't sexist, nor was it ever intended to be. OP asked a pretty broad question, I gave him my opinion in a pretty broad way. I could've sat there saying how ""well, OP, not all gay men have female friends, you fucking sexist"", but I prefer to just answer the question. 

I am very sorry that I didn't summarize the complex and diverse relationship that all ~7 billion (?) humans have with each other in a way that accounted for every single individuals preferences and choices, in response to a very broad question. I didn't realise I hated women and apparently men too. I don't know which gender you're implying I hate here, but I guess I hate both. Thanks for opening my eyes to my wrongdoings, oh good kind sensitive redditor! Good luck patrolling the interwebs, I hope you can find something else that could vaguely be construed as being sexist so you can show everyone just how thoughtful you are! 

You'll have to excuse me now, I've got to go and apologize to my girlfriend for all of those beatings and years of abusive fear induced suppression that I nearly gave her if it wasn't for hawk-eyed activists like yourself, monitoring the things that really matter, reddit anwers!

Keep on making the world a better place, you fucking moron! :)

"First gender is psychological. Their ""original gender"" would be female. Also, it is offensive to say that a trans person is not the sex they feel themselves to be. 

Also, yes religion is not nearly as important to people as a person's sex is. It's fine that you don't want to date a trans person. Everyone has preferences, and that is not that petty of one to have. Some people won't date someone just for hair color after all. "

Starbucks doesn't give you everything but I would never consider it Entry Level. Except for a few lucky individuals and most of them flake off in the first year because they are silly enough to see it as ""entry level.""  
Every pay scale I've seen for Starbucks puts you at least $.20 over minimum wage. If you make it 6 months in: Have another $.50! Christmas  Bonus? Stock discount? 401k? FREE FOOD AND DRINKS? Free coffee/tee/pods mark outs? %30 off year round with %40 off for Christmas?

I'm also sure he probably knows more about this stuff than me, and if this article could be categorized as science fiction, I'd agree with you 100%.

But this isn't written as fiction though, it's speculatively exploring the consequences of actual, current, science, and it's doing so by, IMO, misrepresenting that science. I don't think he did so with malicious or even ignorant intent, I think he did it because he fell in love with the narrative he was trying to push a little too much, and didn't take a step back to look at what he'd written. That really grinds my gears."

"No alimony at all seems a bit unfair.  If a man divorces a woman who gave up her career to be a stay at home mom then there would be no  reassurances for women that marriage would be a benefit, and families would suffer.  I think something more reasonable would look like:

No alimony unless:

* You are not the partner bringing the divorce.

*  A partner left the workforce in order to raise children for more than 6 months, or more time than their employer was willing to offer paternal leave.

* A partner sacrificed a career position in order to move to a job in another area for the other partner.  (for example a guys wife gets 6 figure job in California, so he leaves his own job in new York in order to move with her.)"

"What I didn't like about the chase scene was how many times they used the slo-mo technique.  It's a car chase; what makes it exciting is the sense of speed and danger.  Slowing it down completely kills that.  The parts on the motorcycle don't do this, and this part works very well, but when they're in the white car, they slowed it down constantly.  Why would you want to slow down crashed cars flipping over?  This is the last thing you want to do, but I think they literally slowed down for every car that got crashed into and flipped.  When the Wachowskis followed up the Matrix sequels with Speed Racer, I felt like they were trying to atone for this, like, ""See, we DO know how to do car chases!""  "

"Maybe it's not their conscious choice, but it's what they're doing, and they frequently find excuses if you do suggest this is what they're doing.
The very, very, very simple fact is that if you eat as many calories as you need, you maintain weight, and if you eat fewer, you lose weight, and if you eat more, you gain weight. Exercise and cundishuns and fee-fees are merely things that affect how many calories you need in a day. And if it weren't for all the whiners and SJWs, we could get everyone (not just fat people) to accept this very simple fact, and then maybe they could make conscious choices about their health. Instead they generally have no knowledge of basic nutrition or even what the hell calories are, and just eat the tasty fatty foods that have been scientifically engineered to be as addictive as possible.

"So in short...it's all about taxes.  Your 401K you take your tax benefit early, then you have to pay the taxes at the end.  

Let's say you make 1000 a week.  If your employeer matches at 5%. If you put in 5%, you put in $50 pre tax.  Let's say you do this for 30 years. You'll have personally put in 150K, which is all untaxed. It should grow to close to 2M I believe. You're going to be paying taxes on that full 2M, so at a 25% tax rate, you now paid 500k in taxes.

The ROTH on the otherhand grows tax free.  You pay the taxes on the 150K, but don't get taxed on the growth.  So your tax hit, is at your check, which will result in probably 50k, assuming a 25% tax bracket.  So the difference is a factor of 10."

"&gt;Toleranţa este respectul, acceptarea şi înţelegerea unor moduri de gândire, comportamente, opinii. Fie ele diferite de ale tale.

Păi și nu despre asta e vorba? În opinia mea chestiile gen căsătoriile între persoane de același sex sau adopțiile homosexuală nu ar trebui legalizate. La fel cum homosexualii și susținătorii lor au dreptul să facă manifestații pentru susținerea acestor idei, la fel și ND sau orice organizație sau persoană afiliată sau nu, are dreptul să organizeze contramanifestații. Atâta timp cât cele două grupuri nu își dau în cap unii altora, nu văd unde e problema?

Defapt, mint, eu văd exact unde e problema. Problema este că democrația este pentru fraieri și în realitate nu există. Democrația nu înseamnă că trebuie să modifici legea pentru a mulțumi un anumit grup de interese, ci înseamnă că orice idee ar trebui dezbătută și în final supusă la vot. Metoda prin care se încearcă acum introducerea în societate a căsătoriilor gay este una profund antidemocratică și asta mă deranjează, nu faptul că X sau Y e gay și vrea să se fută în cur.

Dacă se vrea neapărat introducerea căsătoriilor între homosexuali, cel mai corect mi s-ar părea să se supună la referendum, o dată pentru totdeauna, nu că facem acum referendum, mai facem peste 2 ani, între timp încercăm să găsim o portiță legislativă să o trecem prin parlament ș.a.m.d. Nu, un referendum simplu, cu întrebarea ""Sunteți de acord cu căsătoriile între persoanele de același sex?"" Da/Nu. Crezi tu că organizația ACCEPT sau comunitatea LGBT ar accepta o astfel de soluție perfect rezonabilă într-un stat democratic?"

And then we have the women who can easily date football super stars(football, not that shit you got over there) and still I've been with a few, and I hardly have any ''game'' or ''alpha male behavior''.

Women aren't into meatheads, brah. Only in the red pill do people(aka men who are attracted to bodybuilders) think women are wetting their panties over some muscled guy. 6'2''?

Women positioning themselves next to you and praying for you to approach them? Brah, you need to let go of that monitor, turn off the porn you're watching and visit the nearest plastic surgeons. Your face is probably a 3, maybe less.

Women aren't intimidated by you, kid. If that was so no German would get laid. I see guys who are 6'6'' and naturally well -built with attractive women.

"The Equipment Manager of a Professional NFL Team is called ""The Deflator"" amidst a scandal that is about deflating footballs and is receiving gifts from an NFL Superstar, and you have us believe this isn't enough evidence?

The NFL attempts to setup a sting operation after being tipped off by the Colts and fails miserably, because, well, its the NFL and their ability to do anything related to discipline is laughable (Lately they are even in contempt of court!).

You seem to be up against two points as if they are one. First, was Tom Brady cheating. (Probably), Two, the NFL is nothing but a 3 ring circus run by Ringmaster Goodell, who seems to be unable to manage a McDonalds at this point.

Add to that the Patriots have a reputation of bordering that line of whats allowed (Formation vs. Ravens, Spygate), and so its no wonder that people think... yea... Brady probably did it, but not because the Three Ring Circus found him to be guilty, but because it ""feels"" like they are guilty based on all the circumstantial evidence, but you are right, there is no bloody glove and the glove doesn't fit, so while there isn't enough to put him away for life behind bars, there is enough to take some of his money.

"Hey, can we get some sources in this thread? There's a whole lot of brigading from the ""fuck feminists"" crowd.

My understanding is that the woman sent texts that seem to suggest she still had feelings for the guy after the supposed rape occurred. **This does not necessarily mean she wasn't raped. Rape and abuse are extremely traumatic experiences, and they really fuck with people's judgement and emotions. Think of all the classic example of the person who is physically abused by their spouse, but keeps coming back because ""they love them.""**

Reddit *loves* a good false-rape-accusation story. The moment the slightest evidence that she still ""loved"" him came out, it was unanimously decided by Reddit that she had falsely accused him. It's like saying ""yeah, at first she came to the hospital claiming he beat her up, but now she says it was an accident and she still loves him, so obviously he didn't beat her up in the first place."" 

Yes, maybe it was a false accusation (and if it really was, she should face punishment), but it's really, really unwise to jump to conclusions. It's entirely possible that she *was* raped and still continued to send flirtatious messages to him. "

Both seem futile to me because we all have both female and male qualities to us and so like I said sexism works both ways.

Moreover, it has to be acknowledged that the civilizations in Africa are the world's most ancient (this is our mother continent as a species, as far as we can tell); Africans are powerful, not pitiful; and Africans can and should help themselves in addition to receiving aid."

"It's strange that Okinawa is the poorest prefecture in all of Japan, knowing that they have multiple US Base, it's like that the Base is not really helping them economically but hurting them.

Personally, i think removing the base is the right thing to do and it will only hurt them in the short term, and i dont think anyone would like to live near an US base, imagine all the noise and the consequence. (just thinking about that, make me feel bad for the Okinawan people).

And you will probably say that if the US Base leave, that China and NK will invade Japan, but let's be realistic, it's not in the interests of both country and the consequence will be disastrous for China.. economically and domestically.

Keep Fighting Okinawa !

1)Hospitals are mis-staffed more than they are understaffed.  It's a subtle, but very important difference.  I've remarked on it before in previous discussions of hospital staffing.

"There are several studies finding fatty liver in rodents on keto:

&gt;ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as an efficient approach to achieve weight loss [6, 7]. Despite its beneficial effect on weight loss [8], KD induces adverse side-effects such as osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia on the long term [9, 10]. Moreover, KD has been reported to promote insulin resistance in humans [11], which may discourage the use of such diet in obese patients [12]. **Several studies in animals have also shown that KD promotes hepatic steatosis**, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance [13–15], although this has been questioned [16].

Here is what I took everyday to keep things ok to be able to still function:

* L-Theanine - Anxiety &amp; Mood
* Vitamin B6 - Metabolism &amp; Energy
* Curcumin - antiinflammatory
* Nigella Sativa Black Seed Oil - Used to ease opiate withdrawal in opium addicts in the middle east.
* Marijuana - Indica is great for withdrawal
* Gatorade - Electrolytes &amp; Hydration
* Multi-Vitamin with Enhanced Absorbtion - general health
* Magnesium - Leg cramps
* Potassium - Electrolytes
* 5-HTP - Precursor to serotonin, helps with mood
* Holy Basil - Helps with mood
* Kefir/Yogurt - Good for digestive system and easy to eat
* Raw Fruits &amp; Vegetables
* Advil/Tylenol
* Immodium AD Liquid** - Diarrhea
* Some good friends to hang with

** Do not use too much Immodium, as it is an opiate itself. You will find online examples of people megadosing to completely eliminate withdrawal symptoms, only to realize that they were just putting off withdrawal by substituting in a new opiate.

Really, its not that bad. You can do it. Good luck.

She constantly pulls that bullshit of ""well, I'm TWO MONTHS away from being NINETEEN..."" when asked about her age, like she's trying to bump herself up and make herself seem more mature.  She does this in numerous other ways as well, but tl;dr.

Also, I feel like a pedo with eighteen year-olds, and I instantly lose all respect for anyone over 28 years-old who dates girls that age.  You can't possibly have any sort of actual meaningful relationship with these girls -- and if you do, you have the maturity of a high school girl.  Congratulations.

She paid the cost of her share along with the name change fees, to receive a ticket in her name for the journey. She received a ticket (or electronic reservation), in her name, for the specified journey, which is what she paid for.

The original point is that LEGALLY it can be considered child porn (if under 18), and so that no one that gets in trouble, it'd be best to take it down.  So that's all the point was.

&gt;""they're all privileged, upper-class white girls looking for something to bitch about and make themselves feel special""

and you say something along the lines of

&gt;""they're sad, angry little white dudes who are willfully ignorant of...well, everything, and never say anything useful""

these seem equally bigoted and ignorant to me.

Hundreds of thousands of human beings decided to become a part of these communities. I'm sure that many of them are shitty people. I'm equally sure that not *all* of them are shittty people. As I said, they seem to represent some legitimate grievances.

The complaint that things are becoming too politically correct is a reasonable argument to me. Criticizing sweeping frameworks like ""privilege"" is a reasonable argument to me. Claiming that feminism claims to support genders equality but seems to only actually focus on problems experienced by women is a reasonable argument to me. That's not to say I necessarily agree with them, but they are not hateful or ignorant grievances.

When you demonize everyone who disagrees with you, you paint yourself into a little corner where you won't leave to hear the useful things that they have to say.

"The Time Lords of Gallifrey were always stuffy old white Brit aristocrats, mostly male.  The Doctor has always been a slightly Victorian outcast who resents the restrictions of the Citadel, and the weird grandfather/uncle/older brother figure.

It has nothing to do with real world race or sex.  To me the Doctor is an anti-establishment white guy who is paradoxically an authority figure.  To mess with that would bug me.

Then, of course, you run into the issue of the historical Earth settings not being particularly great for women or non-whites a lot of the time.  By having the Doctor be a white male, you get to skip all sorts of dramatic problems that would chew up too much screen time."

Considering that Sweden is one of the most developed countries in the world with the highest living standards and rights for refugees (read:humans), I don't think other Europeans are learning much from them



&gt;Good job implying that european people don't have morals and values while appealing to european morals and values though.

I didn't say Europeans don't have values and morals, but I said that just because the refugees have different morals and values, this doesn't make them barbaric or backwards or whatever other bigoted rhetoric some Europeans spout. Also what European values am I appealing to? Humanitarian values and helping people in need are universal values. "

I'll make an addendum to my ""Nobody wants these"" there are a few ""somebodies"" who want them and that's newbs.  [Newbs](http://i.imgur.com/QzgI3KL.jpg) will pick up half a record or a misspelling or a label pressed right into the groove because they think it has value.  

Take that MJ - Off the Wall half a record pressing as an example.  Hundreds of millions of those things were pressed so in that case there's maybe 3-10 of those defects that got out there instead of thrown away.  But MJ fans don't want it, it's half the music they want.  If they were demos or alternate versions it would have value but as it is in it's current mutation, it has no value.

Now, if that was Elvis or the Beatles?  Those people who are DIE HARD fans regardless of how new to collecting they are would also want those mistake pressings.  So yes, there are exceptions to the all or nothing rule as it always is with vinyl records.  And given the human error factor and all the mistakes that are bound to happen to create a misprint, it's way more common and way less desirable than you'd think.  "

"No, they're not a requirement. NATO can't tell you how to spend your money.

NATO countries have agreed, however, to spend 2% of their GDP on their military. It doesn't tell you how to spend that money, and in fact urges members to cooperate and minimize overlaps. By the way, only a few countries have actually been able to meet that target, one of which is ... Greece. Yes, the country that can't even give its citizens a decent pension has enough money to buy some crap they'll never use, not in the context of NATO anyway.


Because this makes it even more painful: Article 5 of NAT has only been invoked once, during the 9/11 attacks. So all those millions we're burning sending F16s to bomb Syrians? We're not even doing this because NATO wants us to. In fact, *we* originally attacked Iraq, which is the exact opposite thing of what a *defensive* treaty is supposed to do. And yes, I'm saying *we*, because we spineless Belgians are the first to back the US and their dumb wars. And the French of course, because they're possibly even bigger asskissers than we are.


The bottom line is: if we don't spend 2% of our GDP on our military, NATO may be ""displeased"" with us but it ends there. Most NATO countries don't spend that much *anyway*."

"Inheritance taxes are the only taxes the truly super wealthy cannot avoid. Because they're dead. Every other tax they can bribe, dodge, cheat, and evade their way out of. But dead men cannot protect their wealth. And without at least some forms of taxation that impact the wealthy you are looking at a long list of troubles down the road. They are a tax that is hard to find a good substitute for, simply because so few taxes can be effectively applied against the rich in most political systems. 

It practically a saying in Chinese history that when a dynasty loses the political strength and will to effectively tax its rich, the dynasty's collapse is soon after. Not taxing the rich has long term implications for stability and peace within your society that are not pleasant.

The question is how to properly design an inheritance tax. It sounds like Spain starts progressively taxing inheritances starting at anything over ~8000 pounds. The US starts taxing inheritances at anything over $5 million. Spain's tax hits most people. The US's tax only hits the truly wealthy. There are other ways to design an inheritance tax, perhaps the problem isn't inheritance taxes, but Spain's inheritance tax?"

"Happened once in my class. The teacher handed back a big project and asked 20 students (of an engineering class of ~40) to stay after, because their answers were completely identical. Easy to do if it's a math class where the numbers are objectively correct, however this was in paragraph form. Word-for-word copying. 

Such a difficult topic to navigate because as soon as it happens, though. You have the implications of all the students of a single minority race, some not well-versed in English (others were totally proficient, though). Puts the teacher in a terribly awkward spot and the students around feeling meh as well.

Is it socially acceptable to cheat in other countries? I've always wondered if it was normal to copy answers where the students accused of cheating might have gone to school. "

So, as solids are more dense than gaseous matter, and therefore have more units of mass, it is going to take considerably more calories to heat up a constant  volume. Sound would work similarly but as the proximity of atoms are much closer in solids due to a higher density, you get the faster transference of vibrations. (Maybe. This is just me using what is currently in my head to theorize why with no research done at all.)"

"Teams are worried he has a substance abuse issue. They wouldn't outright say it on the NFL Network broadcast but they implied it as intensely as you could.

There are two major red flags. The first is that he tested positive for drugs at the combine. That implies either serious stupidity or a serious issue. The bigger problem was that to prove to teams he had matured, he went across the country and met with a bunch of teams. Problem is, he was 90 minutes late to one meeting and missed the Raiders meeting entirely.

On the NFL Network broadcast Rich Eisen clearly didn't get it and was going on and on about how ridiculous it is to MISS a JOB INTERVIEW and how immature he must be and yadda yadda. Finally Mayock interrupted and essentially said that when you're missing interviews, it's typically drug issues, not just sleeping in or being lazy.

The risk with this guy is that he has a serious issue that he may or may not be able to overcome. It certainly has gotten in the way of the pre draft process, which is a bad sign."

"There's a substantial difference between which day of the week something is harvested and whether the genetic properties of a plant have been altered in some way.

Please note that I have actually taken classes that cover this and understand that there are many beneficial, safe-for-human uses of GMOs. There are also, while safe-for-consumption, bad uses of GMO, such as anti-competitive practices turning perennial plants into annual plants, copyrighting plant strains, penalizing farmers for using seeds, etc. (see *Food, Inc.*).

If I am shopping, I have as much a right to know if my food products may contain peanuts or if the plastic container used contains BPA or if growth hormones were used as much as I have a right to know if my food is GMO. I have the right to understand what kind of GMO process has taken place. I have a right to know if the corn I'm reaching for in the produce isle is the result of thousands of years of evolution or a decade or so of tinkering in a lab. I have a right to know this, and a responsibility to research what impact, if any, such labels have on my life. Companies have a responsibility (that hasn't changed since companies, production, advertising and marketing have even been things) to inform the public about their product and convince us it's okay to buy.

So no, I don't want GMOs to end. We may need them more and more in our changing climate. I do just want to know which products I'm consuming come from GMO sources, so I can be an informed consumer and research what I need to in order to make informed choices."

The ballencing act really gets ahrd with the classes. The tree's alone are an amazing ballence and i credit Bungie a lot on their work their, but what your siggesting doesn't belong in the hybrid they;ve made in Destiny.

Armour, Agility and Recovery are just fine the way they are because if they are modified in any way then we will have hunters going EVEN FASTER with MIDA and RDM, Striker Titans even tougher to kill when fist of Havoking and Warlocks only needing 1 second in cover before they are back to full health in a sniper battle."

&gt;* Tien was significantly stronger than Krillin in the Tien Saga.

You are correct here, but also, Krillin is a child, whereas Tien is practically an adult.

&gt;* Krillin was 1 hit killed by Tambourine whereas Tien mastered the evil containment wave and survived it against Piccolo Daimao, despite it killing both Master Mutaito and Roshi.

Knowing a powerful move doesn't make you any more powerful.

&gt;* Tien put up a better fight against Nappa than Krillin, Piccolo, or Gohan. Krillin only survived because of Goku showing up.

Not true at all. Tien got a few good hits in, but Nappa was messing with him. The only three people besides Goku who actually surprised and hurt him, were Chiaotzu (when he blew himself up), Piccolo (the sneak attack, he knocked him towards Krillin), and Krillin (when he smacked that bitch to Gohan, AND the Kienzan that nearly decapitated Nappa). Tien's attacks (including his most powerful attack) did next to nothing against nappa.


&gt;* Now Krillin gets a power hack from Guru, his power roughly doubles according to the still relevant scouters. In the mean time Tien trains with King Kai; the same training which multiplied Goku's power by ~20.

Except that Tien wasn't there for nearly as long, had to share his training with other people, and was unable to learn the Kaioken (which was the only reason why Goku was strong enough to fight Vegeta). Krillin was stronger than Tien here.

&gt;* Krillin is petrified of the androids and Cell, and provides literally zero contribution to the fight. Tien is not only willing to fight, but capable of holding off semi-perfect Cell for long enough to save his allies.

This is just stupid. Krillin not rushing in blindly to try and fight two people that he knows that he can't beat is something that goes against him? Also, Tien is able to hold back Semi-Perfect cell for a few seconds in the manga, and those few seconds didn't put a scratch on Cell, but nearly killed Tien. Now let's talk about the time where Tien goes to the Cell fight, and explicitly states that he isn't strong enough, and doesn't want to fight, while Krillin is perfectly willing to fight, and holds his own against a Cell Jr.

&gt;* **Krillin gives up fighting for 7 years. Tien continues training for 7 years**.

Doubtful that he gave it up entirely for 7 years. Up until that point, training had been Krillin's entire life. He likely trains a lot still, plus, his training partner is incredibly powerful, while Tien's is Chiaotzu.

&gt;* Krillin dies instantly to Buu. Tien is one of the last surviving humans.

Krillin dies instantly to Buu by charging at him to try and save his family. Tien survives by hiding. This means literally nothing.


&gt;So please, enlighten me where I am wrong? Provide me with a single piece of evidence that Krillin is stronger. Yamcha mollifying a toddler is not evidence. Toriyama mollifying fanboys is neither canon, nor evidence.

And finally, Yamcha may have been comforting Maron when he said that Krillin is the strongest man alive, but his offhand comment where he says ""among the earthlings"" is obviously not aimed at the child. Yamcha can read Ki just as well as anybody else. There is no reason for him to say among the earthlings, if he is comforting a child, so it's safe to assune that's truthful. As for your Toriyama statement, if the person who literally created and developed and wrote every single thing about these characters states that a character is stronger than the other, I'm pretty sure that he knows what he's talking about better than some guy on the internet.

"I've done that already, believe me.

I pretty much don't spend any time around men anymore if I can help it."
"I think we should get rid of the term ""nonlethal"" weapons. It seems to give police the wrong idea. I've seen enough pictures of people who got their heads blown up by getting shot at point blank with a tear-gas canister that the idea of telling police forces that they don't need to be as restrained with ""nonlethal"" weapons as they are with a handgun is absurd to me. 

Just like the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, who are put in the position of having to choose between protecting themselves and their own, or protecting the population, when state violence is used as a mechanism of control, it's inevitable that innocent people are going to die, and that the people with the weapons are going to use them when they choose to-- not when they should. It's an ""us and them"" situation, and they're going to do what they perceive as right, which is making sure other police don't get hurt, by whatever means necessary. When militarized police are used liberally in situations such as public protests, or as crowd control, as a means of repressing, rather than defending, the people, the likely outcome is obvious, and it surfaces over and over every time the state needs to quell dissent. 

We need to demand the restraint of state violence NOW, because the state is never going to voluntarily give up that kind of power. ""Nonlethal"" weapons are just one way that, in a liberal culture, the state can get away with using force against it's own people-- and that term: ""nonlethal--"" is the justification given for why they can brutalize, and occasionally kill, civilians. Because *it isn't deadly force,* it's an *alternative to deadly force*. It just happens to kill and mortally wound people every so often."

"Chromebook Pixel running Ubuntu in crouton is probably the best Linux-based laptop out there.

The only problem is the high price and the limited hard drive space. And it also doesn't work with Windows (maybe you could use a VM but I've never bothered). But it's a great development machine. Not the fastest, but more than decent, especially if you're a developer who needs Linux on the go (like me). 

And the rest of the time, you can close crouton and go back to Chrome OS, and it's the best Web browsing experience you'll ever have. "

"I hear a lot of talk about Wing Chun not having a solid place in MMA but I think it's due to the lack of skill/knowledge.  When training in MMA most people jump on the Wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, or Karate train.  Not many fighters classify their style as Wing Chun and for good reason.  I doubt there is a person with 1/10th the knowledge on the style that Bruce had in the UFC today. Those feints were great, though it is easy to land attacks on willing victims, heh.

"It's hard to say with the first point - I mean maybe we'll have tools which will make them more accessible, although there are no guarantees that the output of a trained neural network will ever be as readable as say a decision tree. 

The thing with the cost of training  a neural network is that the cost is growth related - I think neural networks' training functions are supposed to grow cubically with respect to time, whereas certain techniques allow you to train some types of machine learning model in linear time. What this implies is that even if the hardware does get more powerful, with the cheaper to train systems you may be able to use a lot more data  in your training data which may generate a ""better"" model with respect to performance on your real world data."

"I am not denying that powerful rich people are powerful rich people.  I am denying that being Jewish has anything to do with it beyond inherited friends and wealth among families.

A large group of rich dudes being Jewish does not mean people who are Jewish are different in any way.  Just means friends and family ties are strong and span generations.  In fact, I bet most Jewish people have no ties to these other rich circles who happen to be mostly Jewish.

&gt; Jews tend to have a strong group identity, and tend to work collectively to advance the interests of the group ahead of the society they live in

Every/most groups does this, and I see no reason to suggest Mark Zuckerberg for example is working to help Israel or other Jewish people over his personal profit or ""moving the internet forward"" as he says.  I see no reason to believe he is part of any conspiracy group to help Jewish people over helping himself and other rich people in general.

&gt; They tend to do this more than other groups

Citation needed

&gt; this is how they have survived as a distinct entity despite their relatively small numbers for 2000+ years

Compared to other religious groups?

&gt; Jews have always been involved in money-lending and trading rather than say physical agricultural labor, which has brought resentment, particularly the money-lending part. 

So? That is not the fault of Jewish people, what does that have to do with anything.  People resent entire groups of people irrationally so you should too? That does not help your cause at all.

"Well, for starters it's well-known that La Liga is today a 2-team championship. Atlético is a third-force that is far from the top-2 and hardly makes opposition to Barça and Madrid.

So, for those 5 years Cristiano was playing in a team that is in a much higher level than its opponent for, at least, 34 of 38 rounds.

Now, into the Brazilian background from the late-50s and 60s. If you check any Dream Team of all-time or at least from 2000s it's gonna have, most likely, players from Santos, Palmeiras and Botafogo. Santos was the top force, won 2 Libertadores and 2 Intercontinentals in a row, Palmeiras rivalized with Santos in the state of SP and the Paulista(the championship in the State of SP).

Even though, Santos were the strongest team in the world, when they went to play the national championship(where the champions of the strongers states went) and steamrolled some of the opponents they were often facing teams in a similar level that contributed to the Brazilian National Team(Botafogo, Palmeiras, Bahia, Vasco, Cruzeiro), and so, they knew the players of Santos as opponents and as teammates. Those things combined made ''Santos do Pelé'' lose some key games very often, and that's what makes me think that Brazilian League, even in the beggining, was harder and more competitive than La Liga.

Now to why Brazilian teams were more constant in a international level in that age I can't really give it to you, because Libertadores only started in 1960 and there were few games, Uruguay dominated in the beggining and brazilian teams often didn't like to play because the regional championships were more profitable than the continental in the beggining, kinda like some european teams do today to the World Club Cup.

"You're basically saying that if no one claims to be racist, then racism doesn't exist. True in a scientific way (Karl Popper theories...) but very wrong in approaching social exclusion and obviously a sneaky way to get away from a debate and claiming an issue doesn't exist. 

Sports are gender related, and that lead to gender exclusion. This is a pretty common assertion and you'll find a lot of sociological documentation, empirical studies or newspaper articles with specialists opinion..  [Here](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/what-gender-inequality-looks-like-in-collegiate-sports/387985/) or [there](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/27/sportswomen-second-class-citizens-inequality-governing-bodies) for exemple. You can out the university work of Charlotte Van Tuyckom too. 

As there is no studies based on F1 I can't indeed prove that the same happen in F1. Excuse me for not having a 300 pages thesis on the subject under my bed. However, considering how gender issue is depicted in other sports, I hope you'll agree with me that motorsports, very rooted into ""men"" culture, are *very likely* to be concerned by this issue. If your defense is to claim that I don't have the irrefutable proof of my says, just stick to your position. After all, ""all crows are black"" is a lie since we might see a white one one day. 

And well, if you want one *tiny* clue that could *possibly* lead to the *not proved yet* and *not 100% scientific* hypothesis according to which women *might* face *a sort of* *hypothetical* kind of discrimination in F1, you might wanna hear what the main boss of the discipline has to say about them :

""In 2005, when speaking about IndyCar racer Danica Patrick, he [Bernie Ecclestone] remarked ""You know I've got one of those wonderful ideas ... women should be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances.Ecclestone later called Patrick to apologise, but repeated his comments, before apologising a second time. Earlier, in February 2000, he said that women would never excel in Formula One, stating ""she would have to be a woman who was blowing away the boys. ... What I would really like to see happen is to find the right girl, perhaps a black girl with super looks, preferably Jewish or Muslim, who speaks Spanish.""

2) Wear a lip product you're comfortable with. Liquid mattes are great for longevity, but if they dry out your lips its going to be uncomfortable and will show up in photos. I would honestly recommend a sheer tinted lip balm which will moisturise, have minimal noticeable transfer and will look more natural on your lips.

"I always seemed to me that Alcorn was ultimately done in by tumblr and social media generally. They fostered his delusions to the point where he had to either mutilate himself, which his parents correctly never allowed, or die. It's too bad that his parents didn't throw out his computer when he started to claim he was a woman, he might have lived if he hadn't gotten sucked into worst corners of the internet. 

The really evil thing is that the people who herded him into insanity blamed his grieving parents for the suicide."
"I do agree that *presently* the US is very well off compared to most nations, but I think it would be foolhardy to assume we don't have to even consider the possibility that that could change. I love my country, but we aren't immune to poor decisions and reaping the consequences of those decisions. I'm not referencing the kind of problems that SJWs whine about. Women's rights are pretty damn well off in the US and we've seen a lot of social progress of various kinds in the recent years. On that front, we are doing quite well and should be comfortable. I'm talking more about things that actually do affect the country profoundly. We're 18 trillion dollars in debt and counting, with no sign of a slow in the rising debt. We have plenty of homeless people. We have increasingly severe water crises in some of the biggest agriculture areas in the country (eg California). We have a significant unemployment problem. We have abhorrent education and healthcare systems that both rank *worse* than a significant portion of *third world countries*. We have a number of unsustainably expensive government programs that we're too busy either bickering about or ignoring to actually fix. We can only live on credit for so long, and small problems become much bigger problems when they're ignored rather than nipped in the bud. Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we ignore the ""little things"" until they grow into massive problems, it'll already be too late to fix them without a great deal of hassle and unfavorable solutions. 

I have nothing but sympathy for deeply struggling third world countries. I just don't want to see my country to become one of them because we ignored our problems, stretched ourselves too thin helping everyone else, or were too proud to admit that our country actually does have a lot to fix *even though* we're better off than a lot of other countries. I think we should be taking a long, hard look at how to make America sustainable again before we push ourselves into any more foreign countries. I'm not saying America needs to be a utopia, because it doesn't. However, it *does* need sustainability or we'll all be looking at a whole lot of far more serious problems in the not-too-distant future. "

"oom quite fast? it costs 60 mana. if i play zagara i just sit in lane and do 0 dmg on the creeps. whenever someone comes back in xp range. HK and autoattacks. you wont win any all in early if u 1v1 a zagara.

dimensional shift 75 mana 20 sec cd vs 14 sec cd on HK. again in the long run an unfavourable tradeoff. 

its funny how noobs that have no clue of lane mechanics and highlevel play keep downvoting me tho. while hots doesnt have such emphasise on laning phase like other mobas it is still important early game (on some maps more than others) and you can 1v1 pretty much anyone and play safe with smart creep tumor placements forcing ganks on your lane and enable other lanes to dominate by simple pressing W on your opponent and this is imo unbalanced and offers no counterplay (in a 1v1 scenario)"

"I don't really buy it.  When young kids are learning to ride a bike, they use a [balance  bike](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Toddler_on_metal_balance_bike.jpg) that doesn't have pedals, just to learn how to control the steering and balance.  If he would let people (including himself) start off with their feet on the ground, they would adapt much faster.

Also, I think that many people would be able to handle both operations well enough as long as they thought of them as two separate things.  Take a forklift vs. a normal car for example:  one steers with the front wheels and the other steers with the back wheels.  Forklift operators are still able to drive their normal car home every day, despite the distinct differences in the driving style, pivot points and weight distribution.  They often steer with one hand using the bottom of the steering wheel to compensate.  I understand that a backwards bike and a normal bike have a greater bridge to gap than a forklift and a car, but I think the similarities warrant my skepticism."
"Jared Diamond is attempting to create a Grand Unifying Theory of Anthropology, despite the fact that he is not an anthropologist. It is a problem that he is not an anthropologist because, [as other people have mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1rzm07/what_are_some_of_the_main_anthropological/cdsheth) he cherry picks his data and information. If he had formal training as an anthropologist presumably he would not do this. However, as other people commenting here have noted, Diamond is a popular science writer. Diamond's scientific work is concentrated on birds, but he writes popularly about human societies presumably because he enjoys to and is monetarily successful as a result. Just because the books he writes about human societies are easy to read does not mean that they have a strong scientific background or that they are right. "

"Peter Singer appeared in the Simpsons.  He was the level 5 vegan that wouldn't eat anything that casts a shadow.  I give him kudos for being intellectually consistent, but he's very wrong.  He seems to think equality has value in itself when it's actually just an effect of justice.  
  
Take two groups and look at their differences.  If you treat them differently in a way inconsistent with what makes them different, you're discriminating and need some more equality.  For example, if you have separate water fountains for blacks and whites, you're discriminating because skin color has nothing to do with drinking water.  It's not discrimination to give different skin care advice to blacks than whites.  It is discrimination to deny women the vote because they are capable of making the character judgement necessary to vote.  It's not discrimination to treat them differently in their capacity as mothers.  So it's both unequal and fair to treat humans as the rational animals they are and other animals as the animals they are.  We can eat cows, chickens, dogs, and cats.  They are sensitive so we can respect that and not torture them, but it is the fact that humans are rational that we aren't to be killed.  
  
As he's comparing disabled humans with clever animals, it seems he's lost all respect for species themselves.  Things both living and non are judge by what they are first, then the particulars of the individual, not particulars first.  You start with the fact that the individual is a human and being human is the source of how we treat them.  Their race, economic class, social status, power, mental capacity, etc. come later.   "

I'm going to sound like an ass, but the girl that's the subject of the article is a stupid bitch. Tanning 4-5 times a week as a teenager is dangerous. She engaged in risky behavior and came up on the ass end of it. That's life, tough titty. But now she's trying to 'warn people'. FFS. Shut up. Someone should tell her to have some dignity about her poor choices. If I get skin cancer from tanning, hey, them's the breaks. I know the risks and I do it. And if shit happens, it happens.

"&gt; How do we know the male in the video was strong?

The person I was responding to was equating this with a grown man attacking a 17 year old girl.  I was saying they aren't equal. Imagine what a grown man can do in just 20 seconds to a teenage girl and tell me they're equal.  Yes, this woman seemed to have the slight upper hand, but the boy wasn't in much danger.  Now imagine the grown man beating that 17 year old girl.  Sure they're both bad blah blah, but they're not equal, not by a long shot.

"&gt; Vehicle farming is the cause of base design and splash based weaponry. 

I don't understand what your point is  here.  

&gt;Shotguns are only usable on LA and HA as they are the only classes, which can actually get close enough for them to be usable.

Those are two classes (along with the infiltrator) who are well suited to close combat.  The heavy for surviving there and the infiltrator and light assault for their ability to reach close quarters as a trivial feat.  Why not then give the shotgun to the class *least* suited to close combat?  Surely *that's* the class that could use the edge.

&gt; SMG's lack range due to their accuracy and therefore are in no need to be changed.

This isn't particularly true.  The lack of range is due to quite a bit.  Even if you ignore the accuracy issue (which is really *only* an issue with one of them - the Armistice) the problem is frankly lousy TTK at long range and awful bullet velocity.  It isn't so much that the weapons are inaccurate as it is that they are to difficult to use as effectively as would be necessary to get a kill at range.  Having to hit someone in excess of 15 times (heavy assault with shield on, body shot only deep into falloff).

But it should be pointed out that I'm not concerned with *why* the SMG is a close range weapon.  I've auraxed enough of them to know *exactly* how they work.  The problem is that the SMG class provides highly effective short range firepower in a mobile package.  Handing that to a heavy assault gives that heavy the ultimate 1v1 weapon.  

The SMG is a close combat edge over a carbine or an assault rifle thanks to tight hipfire and over LMGs due to damage output.  It is also more flexible in that regard than a shotgun which either chooses point blank stopping power or middling mid range potential.  There is little reason to give such an edge to a class that already possess a *decisive* close combat advantage.

Don't get me wrong - I can live and shoot mans in a world where heavies use SMGs and do *fine*.  I just don't think that heavies *should* get SMGs.  Other the Jackhammer, I don't think they ought to have shotguns either."

"How about you ask the police in a civilized country. Do you know how many people the police in Germany kill every year? Or the police in the UK? Or in Japan?

Most of the world has police who knows the answer to this question.

But the big secret is that these two tasks are rarely in direct conflict. It is almost always a matter of taking a *small* risk (the person *could* pull out a weapon you didn't know he had, and then he *could* try to shoot you with it and he *might* then fatally wound you), in order to avoid *certain* harm to others. Then, 95% of the time, the result is that no one dies.

If the police instead has a policy of shooting to kill as the first response to any situation, then people are going to die.

If calling the police is going to cause *more* deaths, then the police is worthless.

Heck, the absolute simplest answer to your question is this:

Go home.

If he just goes home and doesn't interfere, then he doesn't risk his life. And he also doesn't kill anyone else.
If he chooses to stay, then it should be because he can achieve a better outcome than that."

This is a problem, and probably a very expensive one.

"You literally have no idea what you're talking about. There are a multitude of problems, both external and internal, and they have to be dealt with differently. This is true for both genders. In your bully example, whether the person being bullied is a male or female doesn't matter. The victim has to do something about it like tell an authority figure, or confront the bully, or whatever.

But then there are deep seated internal issues like PTSD. A soldier coming back from war having watched his friends die around him can't solve his nightmares by fighting someone or killing something. Or a man who was beaten by his alcoholic father and watched his father beat his mother, and now beats his family too. These types of problems have to be solved by talking (therapy or some sort)."

Dave always guaranteed TNA would be dead within 6 weeks after they started. Then after they left Fox Sports he guaranteed they would be dead in 6 months. The dude has had a hard on for TNA for quite some time. I dont know what his deal is but he cannot stand TNA and the TMZ story was false. They claimed Spike was about to cancel Impact, when a show is canceled it is simply taken off the air. Spike didn't cancel Impact, in fact they renewed the deal for an extra cpl of months as they were trying to work out a new deal. But he is Dave Meltzer and he does have legit sources inside the wrestling business, but because of this his constant bullshit is completely ignored despite probably 9 of 10 things he ""reports"" ending up as bullshit. That one that is true supercedes everything else in wrestling fans eyes. There is a reason that PWInsider actually reports shit about TNA and gets right. And there is a reason almost every thing Meltzer reports about TNA is negative, have you not noticed that? They get a little bit of good pub with the Billy Corgan stuff, like the next day Meltzer starts reporting negative shit. "

"I have had difficulty on finding the exact studies on other industries. But I have heard that even in hair care, men are paid more. However, that's why I try to be supportive of these movements because you'll provide much needed balance to the conversation.

And I agree that women are given limited moral power, usually over very small groups of people or things like caregiving or parenting (usually the most authority over unpaid or lower paying jobs like mothering which limits their ability to become much more than they are). What authority they are given and paid tends to dwindle when she might be paid for providing her opinion. How much, is tough to say, and how much of this is just conservatives just being dicks is also impossible to say for sure as well.

However, you'll note, I didn't say men had easy lives. Just the basic level of human decency human respect, to assume a man is competent at his job and intelligent. It's not that men's lives are easy, but that everyone should have  this base assumption. 

Saying this in no way negates that many men have been abused, bullied, assaulted, raped, repressed, and controlled. Also, I sincerely believe giving men more social power will fundamentally change the world for the better. But in the traditional sense of power, men still have most the money, respect, and clout. 

I also believe this is all changing, albeit slowly. People are speaking up about dads parenting over ""babysitting"" which is a nice counterpoint to studies like the one I mentioned."

"She was just not ready to live on her own. She was like 20, but she just didn't have any of the skills that you need to move out of your parents place. She would leave garbage on the floor in the common area all the time, and when I finally snapped an confronted her on the used qtips everywhere, she said I should have just asked her to pick them up. No, hon. I'm not your mom. I will not ask you to pick up garbage. It is not my job to remind you to clean your room. She would leave her dishes in the sink for a week until roommate 3 would clean them. She didn't clean the toilet even once. She would take about a foot of my nice toilet paper to blow her nose in, and then whined when I started keeping my toilet paper in my room. She started buying her paper at the dollar store. I stole 2 squares of her toilet paper because it was so thin I wanted to see if I could take a selfie through it. [I could.](http://i.imgur.com/RAzbJ7T.jpg) One time the [little button thing with the blue and red marks](http://www.americanstandard-us.com/assets/images/productImages/amstd/standard/609.prd.s.002.png) fell out of the faucet and when I put it back I must have put it back upside down since it was backward. She thought the hot water was broken since she was turning it all the way to the red side and it wasn't getting hot, so I had to fix it.

She wasn't ever mean or vicious, but she was also just kind of inconsiderate. She would **slam** doors all the time. She would bang on the shower wall when she showered, which shared a wall with my room. And normally I wouldn't care because it was just a little bit of noise, but she'd occasionally shower at midnight and I had an 8am class. And she was the kind of person who always had her volume on 100%, no matter the situation. But the vanity with the sink and mirrors was right outside my bedroom door, so when she'd be doing her hair or makeup I'd have to put in *my* headphones to hear my show, even though she was the one in the common area. I once lent her a pair of scissors and she didn't give them back until I took them."

With that being said however, part of the improvements should be made should be in resolutions. As 1080 tvs, and even 4k tvs are getting cheaper and cheaper, more people are buying bigger and bigger. 

And they are only gonna continue to go down in price. This is when you start to really notice 720 vs 900 vs 1080. 30fps vs 60. And as these large 1080 tvs are being available to more and more people, and becoming the norm, due to constantly falling prices, these are the tvs that most people are gonna be playing on. Especially now and in the coming years. 

Who wants to hook their new ps4 or xbone up to their new 55 inch 1080 240hz tv, just to get 720p at 30fps? Seriously. What a disappointment that would be. Someone finally is able to afford a tv they always wanted and can now afford, the excitement rages, they fire up their nice new shiny console, just to get an image that looks like someone spread a thin layer of mud all over the screen.

"&gt; Personally, I read a review to hear what that specific person felt about the game, good, bad and in between. I enjoy reviewers who have strong opinions, because that puts them in a meaningful context for me.

opinions are the hallmark of a shitty review. ideally. the review is going to be as objective as possible.

&gt;A generic ""idealized gamer"" review is worthless to me.

why.

&gt;Inherently though, I find that removing political considerations is virtually impossible. I look at games like Bioshock Infinite, GTA or Civilization and they are explicitly political in their messages, structures and how the game world is presented.

not talking about games. talking about reviews. I have literally never seen political or moral commentary in any review I've ever read or watched. let alone a reviewer that let their political/moral views affect the score.

&gt;I found the characters and the general spirit of GTA V to be strongly unappealing. If a reviewer had never touched on those topics, I'd have been misled as a customer.

there is nothing moral or political about unappealing characters."

Doesn't answer the question. Nor does your link even get close to what my rhetorical question is posing.

&gt; Yes, those that commit more crime are more likely to get arrested.

So, for example, racial profiling would not be a non-trivial counter explanation?

&gt; What demographic trends?

Age would be a key example demographic. ""whites, ""blacks,"" and ""others"" do not share the same demographics or socioeconomic standing. There are trends within the groups. Age, income, education, family structure, etc, etc. Good luck teasing that all out and then pointing at, hey race is obviously the key factor here.

&gt; Read about it here

So point me to the place, please, that brakes it out and attempts to actual apply real statistical analysis instead of just pasting raw data and pretending that it means something.

Edit:
And either way, you just completely skirted over the fact that the graphic is clearly misrepresenting its source. ""reported arrest"" simply does not mean ""responsible for""."

"&gt;At some point you have to step back and question how great the idea really was. It clearly failed to take into account base human behavior, was passionately written during a time of tumult and separatism, and had glaring flaws which the founders themselves pointed out and warned us against. They may have been on the right track, but I think we can all agree that it certainly wasn't perfect.

The idea was amazing, just far too ahead of its time. 

&gt;In the absence of a government, and with as many humans as we have on this planet, someone will inevitably make up new rules, and people will follow them. Should the world fall into complete chaos a new order would quickly establish itself and work toward increasing its power. I can't imagine that most humans actually want fierce independence, especially not in the face of complete chaos. We like the conveniences that come with cooperation. A large majority of people absolutely do want (or need) to be taken care of by one another.

Absence of government...um...They created a government. The founders were hardly anarchists hahaha
 
&gt;Creating strong, intentional, *functional* government to ensure the well-being and prosperity of our species takes a unique skill set which few ""free"" animals on this planet have. In my mind we'd be absolutely foolish to squander that opportunity in the pursuit of such a nebulous ideal as ""freedom"". My version of ""freedom"" is surely quite different from yours.

Correct. That's why the founders wanted us all to live as freely as possible. 

The founders did create strong intentional government. They just didn't want New Yorkers deciding how someone in California or Omaha should live.

&gt;Trans guy/girl who identifies as that gender but wants to use ""xe"", &gt;""xim"", ""xer""? No deal.

Why no deal? Why is it so difficult for you? Someone has both sets of genitalia and does not feel as if they are man or woman? Xe. becomes appropriate. 

Now granted, you can't just know what genitalia a person may or may not have but lets say you're in a professional setting and meeting a new client. You introduce yourself and say ""pleasure to meet you Mr. Smith, to which they very calmly, very politely, very simply say, ""oh it's Xe."" Are you going to in turn request for them to pick one end of that spectrum or the other?

Every example you provide about ""human nature"" is completely incorrect. As social creatures, the only thing that is human nature is for us to refer to each other via grunts and sounds, which though society and culture, we have all agreed a given grunt or sound means something. Shortening names has nothing to do with human nature, and my argument is still valid as I've met people who are maybe named Chad but prefer the name Frank.

Mr. and Ms./Mrs, or mister and misses, are contractions of Master and Mistress and the contractions only came to prevalence during the 1500's. So again, nothing with human nature. Now we're getting into some lords and serfs shit which is all kinds of patriarchy up in here. Haves and haves nots. Bourgeoisie and proletariat. Really, given that context it might be better to start referring to everyone as the non gender, non hierarchical Xe because ain't no one my master but me.

"I probably will have quit D3 by 2.3 I find myself really bo so I dont really care anymore however these things need to change if they want to keep players:

* Paragon grind is out of control and has permanently damaged the game - the Meta is now getting to Paragon 1000 and nothing else, the Elitism with that is ridiculous. Cap Paragon at 800 for future Seasons so people can actually PLAY the game, gear other classes etc instead of just grinding for weeks until the final few days for them 'pushes'..

* Trials took too long to be removed, even if they get removed right now it doesnt really matter due to group Grifts getting keys you want made much easier and anyone in a clan/good group doesnt have issues getting high keys anymore since you just speed clear 11 levels lower than your target (want 54 keys.. speed through 43's) 

* No new Set content without making other things 'shit'. Roland replaces Akkhan. N6/UE replaces M6. Wastes replaces Raekor. R6 replaces SWK... and so on and on they add in new Sets and make others obsolete because they make them TOO powerful, they dont just add another 'viable' set, they completely unbalance everything

* Bounties are boring (Why the fuck do we need to do bounties anyway?), T6 rifts are boring - Goblins are fun but are too rare to be significant. Give me a rift full of Gelatinous only and it will be fun

* Ancient items need a Consumable drop, the RNG of Ancient Weapons is fucking brutal. Paragon 80 with BiS Ancient Golden Flense but Paragon 750+ Cant find a single Ancient, its like Blizz checks your Date of Birth/playtime and only awards you with an Ancient if you are over 35 or play less than 2 hours a week because ive seen some weird shit with Ancient drops and RNG doesnt seem to be a factor at all.

* Wont improve Materials situation even though everyone has whinged/complained for 1+ year about this. Is it really so hard to go into the coding and change 'Arcane Dust from '4' to '60' when you complete a GR 45+?! I guess so.

* Wont remove Pylons even though everyone dislikes them in Grifts

* Improve the boring affix's on mobs. I never _feel_ like im fighting a certain mob yet feel more like im fighting Arcane Sentry/Frozen more."

"&gt; Ah, the call to authority. How did I know that was coming? You know more than me because you were a teacher. News flash, I had a lot of unimpressive high school teachers and I taught university for several years (yes, a lot of unimpressive uni profs too).

I didn't say that I know more than you. I said that I've spent time with teenagers in an authority position and that's the experience that informs my judgment on this matter. If you don't have similar experience, I don't care. *Something* makes you so sure of yourself, right?

&gt; I don't call what the teacher did ""lying."" According to her testimony, she said nothing about why Hae didn't show up to Adnan so it's interesting that you characterize that as lying as if she had some obligation to communicate to Adnan that Hae didn't want to see him.

And yet it's commonly said here that the teacher was ""hiding"" Hae from him. Was she doing that? The implication is clearly danger, and it's clearly that there was deceit involved, because ""hiding"" means pretending not to be present. If she wasn't hiding Hae, then what on earth does this incident show? It shows that Hae had a moment when she didn't feel like talking to Adnan and was not going to show up for her regular gig in the teacher's classroom and wanted the teacher to ""pretend"" she was talking to someone else while this was communicated. I guess when the teacher went along with the pretending, she was being totally honest. Right?

&gt; What else did Adnan do that showed a potentially violent attitude toward women?
&gt; Told Jay he was going to kill Hae, said he killed her where he used to eff (robot warnings) her.

If you believe Jay. I don't.

&gt; Told the same kill/eff location story to Ja'uan.

What?

&gt; Discussed how to kill a GF with Yasir.

Not in evidence.

&gt; Crashed girls night and demonstrated signs of possessiveness.

lol. Brought a cake (which Hae liked!) and somethin somethin somethin signs to be named later.

&gt; Hung out with Imran who thought it was a barrel of laughs to send email to Hae's friend telling him she had been stabbed.

This means everyone who hung out with Imran (or was merely copied on the mail) was showing violent tendencies? Or just Adnan?

&gt; Wrote ""I'm going to kill"" on a break-up note from a girl who was subsequently murdered.

On the back of that note, actually, and let's not forget what Hae's best friend wrote on that same back of note . . . did Aisha also have violent tendencies toward pregnant friends?

&gt; He sounds like an all-around great guy, doesn't he?

Well, if you read Becky's testimony, he does. I don't pretend to know more than anybody who actually knew him, but if this is your complete list of evidence that he was hiding a murderous nature, I'm not convinced.

I understand C3 not wanting to compete with RB4, but now it's starting to become a problem when SUPERIOR tracks are getting removed with the ANNOUNCEMENT of songs for RB4, a game that won't even be out for another 6 months. And regrettably, when RB4 finally does come out and they start up DLC again, there will probably be a lot of overlap between songs that the C3 customizers have been working on, which means more and more songs that will lose ANY keyboard support.

So why is it okay that they still keep Guitar Hero conversions up? Heck, they even converted the entire Beatles Rock Band game, AND added keyboard support for some songs."

The answer is quite simple, using research and statements from various well-versed scientists on the topic. Radiocarbon dating doesn't work well on objects much older than twenty thousand years, because such objects have so little C-14 left that their beta radiation is swamped out by the background radiation of cosmic rays and potassium-40 (K-40) decay. Younger objects can easily be dated, because they still emit plenty of beta radiation, enough to be measured after the background radiation has been subtracted out of the total beta radiation. However, in either case, the background beta radiation has to be compensated for, and, in the older objects, the amount of C-14 they have left is less than the margin of error in measuring background radiation. As Hurley points out:

""Without rather special developmental work, it is not generally practicable to measure ages in excess of about twenty thousand years, because the radioactivity of the carbon becomes so slight that it is difficult to get an accurate measurement above background radiation.""

Cosmic rays form beta radiation all the time; this is the radiation that turns N-14 to C-14 in the first place. K-40 decay also forms plenty of beta radiation. Stearns, Carroll, and Clark point out that "". . . this isotope [K-40] accounts for a large part of the normal background radiation that can be detected on the earth's surface"" . This radiation cannot be totally eliminated from the laboratory, so one could probably get a ""radiocarbon"" date of fifty thousand years from a pure carbon-free piece of tin. However, you now know why this fact doesn't at all invalidate radiocarbon dates of objects younger than twenty thousand years and is certainly no evidence for the notion that coals and oils might be no older than fifty thousand years."

"&gt;What would have prevented it? 7 years? 10? Staying there forever? I'm legitimately curious what your thoughts are.

I tend to think that if we would have just been sitting troops there without any real combat threat, what does it matter if we stayed there as long as we have stayed in Germany or Japan?  The cost to us, in terms of the total budget, would be a rounding error for 10k troops.

I don't think the Arab Spring would have been stopped if we had been in Iraq, so I think ISIS would probably have emerged, but never would have been able to get out of Syria (lest we kick them back in).  Its an interesting debate as to what would have happened.  Most certainly we wouldn't have had the Yazidi and Kurdish crises we did have.

"&gt; I don't think that there's a good argument that the government has the right to tell the citizenry of the country that we should engage in a war against their wishes in order to protect some nebulous interests abroad, personally.

And this is a reasonable disagreement.  It's a fundamental difference in how we view the government's role, which is fine.  I think you're completely wrong, but it's not an invalid point of view, either.

This was the type of point of view, however, that kept us from entering World War II responsibly.  The government was forced to plan in secret (as we learned from the Rainbow Five leak), and arguably resulted in our inability to respond to the situation in Europe in a timely or even humane way.  There's a reason why the sort of popular isolationism is basically dead now.

&gt; I do think this is exactly the same sort of government paternalism that I see Conservatives decry constantly in other areas.

This is only true if you think the military is not a role of government.  Conservatives do, and they rightfully point to the constitution as part and parcel of that role, including but not limited to granting the power of Commander in Chief to a civilian who is not directly elected by the people."

You see, smart means intelligent, but in reality, you are an idiot, so the word is misused, and does not convey the actual meaning.

"But the problem is this type of labeling only furthers the narrative of black vs white. That black people are inherently violent because of their skin color. And also that white people as inherently racist. 

If this was a video about a bunch of white people fighting like this, you wouldn't blame it on ""white culture"" or that ""video games are instilling violence among white youth"". You would probably call them a bunch of violent idiots or something similar and be done with it. But since this video is about blacks committing the violence, the narrative suddenly shifts to, ""What is wrong with black culture"" and ""rap music is promoting violence"", casual reference to monkeys etc (Not saying you made these claims.

Now if I had just made half a billion dollars selling books describing it...


Writing about author's regrets is like writing about what your dog DIDN'T have for dinner.   L Ron Hubbard wrote a ten book series called ""Mission Earth"" and each book had well over 200,000 words in it and while somewhat addolescent in writing it was full of completely predictable actions on the characters parts and variable outcomes to those actions do to the characters' oversights and ignorances.   But L Ron Knew not to regret what he did with his little imaginary puppets, he wasn't a psychopath just a sociopath.

You see RR walking around with a happy look on his face all the time.   The man has sex with his Ego, Id and every woman in his novels every time he sits down to write.  He languishes in them, curls them over like good bath bubbles then beats them to death time and time again.   I wouldn't trust his inner child with a pile of pork fat in a cloth sack.    Know what HE regrets?  That he considers that Death should be Final.   Not who he did it to and how.  Nope.   He kills his characters a thousand times and they thank him for the experience.

When you ask a writer if they have any regrets... they're gonna do what they do professionally: make up some shit that will sell.

So it has the possibility to land up sandwiched between two huge and heavy boxes. So if you choose to put your hollow glass bong in a Walmart box  (easily the cheapest and shittiest boxes in the world) with nothing but some packing peanuts to protect it, count on it arriving broken.

good thing i'm anti-free speech
"&gt;I feel like you are being argumentative for the sake of it, but hey ho

No. I argue because saying that Math is language is stupid.

&gt;Explain to me why.

Because math is pure abstraction. You have function f(x). You can find its derivative f'(x). But it means nothing in real life. If you assume that f(x) is coordinate then f'(x) is speed. If you assume that f(x) is speed then f'(x) is acceleration. Yeagh, derivative means how fast value changes but it is pure abstractions. We just model reality with mathematics and call it Physics.

&gt;You are treating it like a chicken/egg thing, as though humans happened upon math.

No. What made you think so?

&gt;Mathematics is the symbols and the words. 

No. = is symbol. ± is symbol. We use these symbols in math. It is math language. I transfer you ideas through words. But those ideas aren't language. I use English language but I could use another one. It is incorrect to call those ideas language.

&gt;The relationships themselves don't even require the term math to exist.

Relationships is part of what math studies. 1+1=2 is math. It is relationship. 1,+,= and 2 are symbols, they are part of math language which I used to express idea, part of math.

&gt;Now you're just trolling.

No.

&gt;Language of mathematics and mathematics are the same thing.

Have you ever heard someone saying language of English?

&gt;The same way programming and the language of programming are also the same.

No. Programming is the process of creating programs. Analysis, creating algorithms are part of programming. 

&gt;Same deal. Math and the math language(s) are the same thing. This is why I keep saying you are being philosophical: 

No. Ideas and language which you use to express it aren't the same.

&gt;it's like a person trying to explain why reality could exist only in our heads but in the end it doesn't matter.

No. It is completely irrelevant analogy.

Edit: Just btw, a few kids coming into your yard for their ball- not exactly the worst kind of trespassing. This sort of behavior used to be considered a given in this country- only the scary old man who hates everybody wouldn't let kids retrieve their toys that went over the fence. Like I said elsewhere, the neighbors should obviously exhibit a little more control- but this guy is trying to put an end to their livelihood. Which isn't hurting anybody, it just annoys OP."

It comes across as you don't believe that you are enough as yourself for the girl. So you are trying to make up for it by doing these ""nice"" things. Doing nice things to women is not bad, do it out of good will, not out of ulterior motives nice most nice guys who believe they deserve the girl because they put effort into being nice for that girl, while confident guys believe they are already good enough."

I don't really give a shit about either side of the ""controversy"" that is been regurgitated by both sides over who is the least prejudice and open-minded, non-bigot on topics X Y and Z, (and of course more importantly, why the other side is a stupid doo-doo head.)

From what I vaguely recall, Polygon is essentially Kotaku-lite, with a more tiresome spin on SJW tripe.  Is that what the author is upset about?  Why not just...I don't know, completely ignore shitty websites that have stupid opinions?  There's plenty of them out there and I don't get upset every time I see someone with a stupid misinformed opinion over something.  I don't feel the need to call them out.  I just...disregard them into the empty void where they belong.

Unless Polygon is doing some kind of defamation of character against the author, or some other equally sleazy shit I just can't imagine why he even gives a shit.  Anyone happen to have a quick write up so I wont have to wade through that shitpool?"

"The lack of a removable battery can't be rationalized away as a missing feature when compared to any phone that has a removable battery. It is a significant design defect. There are no functional improvements gained for the consumer by locking the battery in the phone, but there are plenty of positive gains for the manufacturer. The S6 is an amazing device that was ruined by one design decision that pandered to all the dimwitted Apple users that still don't understand the benefits of a removable battery. These devices are designed, in every way, to be totally portable and powered by a battery while being used, not to be connected to a power outlet with a 6 ft. cable.

If you are spending any time being forced to use a smartphone while it is connected to a stationary power source, then your device is badly designed, or you don't understand how to properly use it."

"&gt;You can't seem to tell the difference between political questions and technological ones

I don't think I did anything of the sort. I certainly stated that technological changes can cause economic changes.

&gt;Yes, other systems do function; in fact many function far better on a wide range of metrics than the current system 

I don't think so. I haven't been much impressed by the history of socialist states so far. It seems that the most effective form of socialism, if you could even call it that, would simply involve generous people working hard and then giving their money to those who need it. In other words - effective altruism.

&gt;(and that's ignoring the international side of the question - which is frankly hypocritical when the whole point of this ""effective altruism"" idea is to consider people in other countries on an equal level of importance to people immediately next door). 

I don't have any intention of ignoring international people. I wrote about America partially because that is where I have the best understanding and also (more importantly) because that's exactly what we're discussing: the virtues of being a Wall Street banker.

&gt;Once again that political blindness lets you tell yourself that kind of mythology that nobody is ""harmed"" in a system that still depends on huge (but still totally insufficient) social welfare spending to prevent huge numbers of people from literally starving. 

Of course many people are left behind. But it's still better than before. I'm not saying that ""as long as you're not doing direct harm, you have no responsibility."" Of course not - otherwise I wouldn't be here taking about EA! But the responsibility of a capitalist to pay his workers a living wage is really not much different from anyone's responsibility to donate money to workers as well.

&gt;Voluntary exchange is an improvement, but most exchanges are forced on a number of levels. 

...sort of. Obviously workers are often compelled to take certain jobs due to economic realities, where the alternative is worse or unthinkable. But this also means they are better off from the opportunity. The problems with workers in the global South often come from their initial situation where their society has a history of being exploited by colonialism leaving them without property and stability. But international investment is not the cause of that.

&gt;And that's totally irrelevant; you could replace ""capitalism"" with ""feudalism"" or ""slavery"" and it would still have been true back when they said it. Those benefits have derived from technology, not the economic system. 

I haven't studied feudalism much, but I'm quite sure it was a better system than most of what came before. So yeah, it's still valid. I don't think it's absurd to say that feudalism was an improvement of some kind. I'm also sure that slavery caused more harm than benefits. Forcing dozens of people to be miserable for the benefit of a single family - that's not a good action by any measure.

Edit: also, many of our technological improvements come from capitalism."

Spending time with them is like rock climbing without a safety line, it is taking a completely unnecessary risk.

Relevant:
[Wikipedia: Wolf attacks on humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_attacks_on_humans)

&gt; Wolf attacks are more likely when may be preceded by a long period of habituation during which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans . . . A worldwide 2002 study by the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were children under the age of 18, especially under the age of 10. In the rare cases where adults were killed, the victims were almost always women. This is consistent with wolf hunting strategies, wherein the weakest and most vulnerable categories of prey are targeted.

Wolves are not your friends.

&gt; Further reason for the vulnerability of children is the fact that some may mistake wolves for dogs and thus approach them.

I suspect that children aren't the only ones mistaking wolves for dogs.

I would also like to bring up that while I am very appreciative of the feminine form, I am of the opinion that someone's genes or the genitals they were born with do not quantify their gender. I find no difference in trans women or ""biologic"" women when it comes to what I find appealing or attractive. If a woman is a woman, who is anyone to argue?

I'd say there's a vast difference between the bottom 20-30 and the top 20-30 and where they end up and what they think of themselves. Most people at the bottom end up content with it and don't really change afterwards, it almost sounds like you're quite proud of those accomplishments of yours, but it's just really average. There's tons more competition at the top ranks and that really helps people get better, and I think instilling that kind of desire helps above all else."

"That's really close to what I think as well. I don't deny I have my own ""moral code"" if you want to call it that, but I can't call it ""good"" and be intellectually honest as well (in my own mind I suppose). 

And I do think a lot of it comes down to being culturally blind and just following the majority of the western (I guess new atheist purist? I'm not sure what to call it) crowd. Also, I try to be as clear about my positions as possible (and I posted them above) but I think my position goes against the political rhetoric (which I think is a big reason why they get angry...don't argue religion or politics at the dinner table). 

There is another aspect to this as well with regards to child abuse:

Let's say, someday in the future, society is mostly anti-theist and decides to define the teaching of religion as child abuse (their are some now who believe this). Some I've talked with would like to legislate against teaching religion to children and they use terms like brainwashing. 

Ok, so I'm trying to look at this from an amoral neutral perspective (putting aside my own moral feelings) and I'm starting to see some problems and inconsistencies. These are the questions I ask (maybe I should start another post):

1) At what age do they stop being a child and you can tell them about religion?

2) What method would the state use to enforce the law?

3) What is the punishment for breaking the law? (Do the children get confiscated, do the parents go to jail, etc.)

4) Does the term brainwashing include teaching about the supernatural or other philosophies (like humanism)?

And there is more, but if I deny their moral justifications for the child abuse thing because I point out they haven't justified it except by maybe majority rule, they get angry. 

Because it seems to me, if you can convince people that something is ""morally good"" you can get away with anything. That is my problem with this particular cross section of atheists. "

After the collusion deal was in place with Apple, the publishers basically went to Amazon and said you will do this deal to raise ebook prices or we will not sell books to you.

It's amazing what a few years can do though - the Ipad isn't even marketed as an ereader today. Apple has recognized that consumers do not buy Ipads to read books, so I doubt a deal like that would had been conspired today."

You know very well, that Russians do not speak about the ""west"" any better (in fact rather worse I would say, as only minority of people here is intrested in Ukraine and Russia to speak about it).

No it is not. I do not want to get stuck in another flame, but I have to mention it, as I'm confident that this is the real pivot point of our disagreement.

I hope so. But it is better be preppared do defend ourself and our allies (included Baltics you were talking about).

&gt; ... unless they start abusing them, they're pretty safe too.

Sorry and no offense, but Russian leadership is rather unpredictable. Now add to it, that one of the things we know for sure about Mr. Putin, is that he in fact doesn't give a fuck (sorry for that term, but my limited knowledge of english prevents me from using more subtle expression) about his people, so all this mess about Russians abused in Ukraine is just excuse. Then we can't but to reallize that nobody is safe now.

It's hard for me to look at girls that are crazy lean like this. Girls carry fat well, why not have a little? It feels nice too. Body isn't everything I care about but if it was up to me I'd take a thick girl over a lean bodybuilding chick any day.

I have A LOT of free time, I have money and I don't need to work, I live alone without girlfriend or family or pets. Basically I have 3 or 4 lectures a day, I go to the gym. That's it. I can theoretically play Rust for the rest of the day. I don't do that, I have many other activities to do, I paint, I make music. But I have my computer running 24/7, if my friends call me ""We are being raided"" I can be awake and online in Rust in under 3 minutes most time of the day. ANd I'm not alone, we are 5 (sometimes up to 9) people living like this and all playing Rust.

You cannot compete with that. Don't take this personal, but there is nothing the Devs can do about this. People like us will ALWAYS be 'better' (lacking a better word) because we have more time to play.

There's nothing illegal about killing animals you own, you just have to do it in a state-sanctioned way. And agents of the state can kill any animal at will, without consequence, even by discharging a firearm in a residential neighborhood.

"So now you're driving around in MRAPs and antagonizing the general population. Who does that put at risk in the long-term? Police militarization is out of control. There is a trust problem that is deteriorating, and this is one of the driving forces behind that. This is a fundamental problem, and the longer it's denied the worse it will get.

&gt; The rest of your post is your opinion of police and SWAT teams, which however misguided, you are entitled to have. 

Misguided? You have seen photos of Ferguson protests, right? You think what the world saw there is appropriate law enforcement behavior? That was not an isolated incident. This kind of heavy-handed force that was once rare has become routine. And opinions are nice to have, but those SWAT use statistics are statistics, not opinions. You can deny fact all you want, but that doesn't get you anywhere. 

&gt; They are needed. And you are being naive if you think they aren't. SWAT teams aren't bullet proof. 

Sure they're useful. A lot of things are useful. That's why the military industrial complex is constantly producing more sophisticated equipment and weapons, but those are for the military for very different uses. I think most people would agree that law enforcement in our society serves a very different purpose, and limits on what law enforcement is armed with and what they can do is by design. I firmly believe that the SWAT raids that have become more commonplace are not appropriate, and neither is every other aspect of increased law enforcement militarization. This problem is not going to get fixed by asking for more MRAPs or god knows what else will come in the future. It'll just make the problem worse. Seeing MRAPs during protests (like in Ferguson) does not inspire confidence in law enforcement. It looks very authoritarian. They are not tools without downsides.

EDIT: To all you idiots downvoting me, you should probably fact check before you downvote. If you think [79% of SWAT raids](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/06/27/aclu-j27.html?view=print) being used to execute search warrants is normal (most of them simple drug-related search warrants) then you're out of your fucking minds.

I then point to my watch and the sign that was posted.  sorry.  i'm coming in.  he puts his hands on us and pushes me and my wife back and says go.  mind you, i'm 6'2"", 220 pounds and he looked like danny DeVito.  I say fuck you i'm coming in- at that point his English got a whole lot better.  wife snuck in and did her thing, all the while me and him are throwing insults back at each other... I was so heated I didn't have to go to the bathroom- but I went in anyway and pissed all over the floor and toilet paper rolls he'd just replaced.  he ended up calling the cops on us but the camera outside the front door had him pushing us and nothing more.  so we spent all of two minutes being questioned.

It will also broadcast negetive effects, so poison and slowness could be a factor. Gold armor will not replace donkey double chests, if anything it will probably increase their use, as combined you would have 2.5DCs of storage space. And, while I kind of agree that invincible horses is a bit gimmicky (I am adding it for people that like horses), things like no knockback, no arrow damage, and actual invisibility will be actually useful, not gimmicky.

"&gt;There is a time zero at which I have a set of alternative courses of action, a time one at which I select a course and a time two at which I perform the course selected. If we wind time back to zero, then either there is no course of action selected at time one and performed at time two, or there is such a course. Forget about winding time back and this just becomes either at time zero there is no fact about which course of action I will select and perform, or at time zero there are facts about which course of action I will select and perform. The first case is that of a non-determined world, the second is that of a determined world, so, as the libertarian holds that the world is non-determined, they will (or at least should) reject the thought experiment on the grounds that there can only be a course of action to do the same as or different from, if the world is determined. In short, the thought experiment begs the question against the libertarian by introducing a hidden assumption of determinism.

At your ""time zero"", the cosmos is in a specific state and therefore your brain, consciousness, and its contents are in a specific state. This state determines what choice you will make (determinism), and even if it didn't (indeterminism) the choice would still arise of perfectly mysterious origins around which using the word 'free' makes no sense. In either world, there is no one to be free to choose in the first place.

&gt;Determinism is a global thesis, all or nothing. If a world is determined, it is determined as a world, in its entirety.

Determined and *pre*determined are not synonyms. You seem to be treating them as such. Determinism and randomness (e.g.) are not necessarily exclusive. 

&gt;Conversely, in a non-determined world nothing is determined, so, in a non-determined world we cannot talk about things ""determining"" other things unless we are using a different ""determine"". But this is one of the most important terms in the discussion, so we should not use it to mean anything other than its technical meaning, unless we make it quite clear what we do mean.

So ... how did this comment reply get into your brain then?"

"If your goal is to pick the best doctor, lawyer, or employee, why wouldn't you pick the one with the best credentials?

Considering two Harvard graduates, one Chinese and one black, the Chinese graduate literally had to be the best of the best throughout their entire academic career.  The black person, while undoubtedly very accomplished, didn't need to be nearly as good academically.  So, all else being equal, why wouldn't I go with the hypothetical Chinese graduate?

This sort of thinking sucks for black graduates of Harvard that achieved it based on merit alone -- unfortunately that's the cost of a race-aware system and why I oppose it."

Wheeler is clearly guilty of firing his gun, and therefore shares in the responsibility for anyone shot in this exchange, but until a full investigation is completed, we do not know if Orozco was shot by friendly or enemy fire.  So please stop saying that Wheeler shot Orozco until the evidence is in. It makes you look like a slack jawed yokel carrying a torch and a noose."

1. Your initial comment stated that the woman in the picture, dated from the late 1920s,  looked like she was tired of not being to vote among other things. 

2. I replied to your comment stating that the 19th amendment was ratified in 1920, giving women the right to vote. Any time needed to actually put this into practical effect was certainly long expired by the time the late 1920s rolled around. 

3. You even indirectly acknowledged that my comment was correct by stating that she was old enough to have going through the period where women were not able to vote.

4. I then stated that although this was true,  at the point the picture was taken she would not have ""looked like she was tired of not being able to vote"" because this was no longer the case in the late 1920s. I never said that women's  suffering was over by the time of the late 20s, just that they were able to vote and this would not contribute any longer to their unhappiness.

"I was raised and continue to be an atheist.  I never really noticed any Christian mythology elements because I don't know what they are.  It's definitely not obvious.  I think the people in Tolkien's books are generally a-religious.  They don't really pray, or read a bible or go to church.  And the mythology is assumed to actually be real in middle earth.  Unlike god in reality, which is fake.  I can easily suspend reality for fiction.  That's the problem I have with religion: In real life people actually believe it.  I've never met anyone that thinks Tolkien's works are non-fiction.  If there were a huge group of people who believed in Tolkien's world like they believe in the bible then I would like his writing a lot less just because of the stupidity it inspired in that hypothetical situation. 

I'm not religious and don't care about any themes Tolkien borrowed from Catholicism any more than his borrowed themes from all the other mythologies he used.  Obviously his stories weren't invented out of nothing.  And I don't think it was his intention to hide the fact that he was basing things off of other mythologies.  He didn't make up elves and dwarves and wizards etc, and I don't think anyone reads Tolkien believing that he invented every aspect of everything in the books either.    "

"So that's why Rodwell has warned young players that their career could be ruined by moving to Man City? What about players like Sturridge, Sinclair, Jo, Adam Johnson?

&gt;Rodriguez's World Cup was why he was signed. It's a simple as that.

Rodriguez has been a name since Porto. He got the most assists in Ligue 1 last season, and became the top scorer in the World Cup at the age of 22. Of course he was a target for a midfield replacement for Di Maria, who would you rather have signed? 

&gt;And it was that, because they had Di Maria. A player who'd just had a fantastic season, a player the manager, and the other players, didn't want to leave. But he was forced out by the president, who'd decided that Rodriguez was the better fit.

Di Maria wasn't a one sided affair. His salary demands were ridiculous, and couldn't be met at the current salary structure, he already had a raise not long before that. Half a good season doesn't warrant a ridiculous salary at Real Madrid. James Rodriguez has shown this season to be a better and more consistent player than Di Maria ever was at Real Madrid, and only at the age of 23. Great piece of business.

&gt;Navas was highly rated before the World Cup, yes. But it wasn't until his World Cup performances that he truly came onto Real's radar.

&gt; Ukrainians are divided into almost two equal camps in their attitude to Kyiv Euromaidan: **50 percent of Ukrainians don't support Euromaidan, while 45 percent have the opposite position,** according to the December research conducted by Research &amp; Branding Group.

&gt;Regarding the forecast of Euromaidan future, 43 percent of citizens said that its consequences sooner could be negative, while 31 percent of the respondents thought the opposite. Besides, 17 percent said that the Euromaidan would bring no negative consequence

**Ukraine crisis: Transcript of leaked Nuland-Pyatt call**

&gt;The US says that it is working with all sides noting that ""ultimately it is up to the Ukrainian people to decide their future"". However this transcript suggests that the 
**US has very clear ideas about what the outcome should be and is striving to achieve these goals**. Russian spokesmen have insisted that the US is meddling in Ukraine's affairs - no more than Moscow, the cynic might say - but **Washington clearly has its own game-plan.**

&gt; Various officials attempting to marshal the Ukrainian opposition; efforts to get the UN to play an active role in bolstering a deal; and (as you can see below) the big guns waiting in the wings - US Vice-President Joe Biden clearly being lined up to give private words of encouragement at the appropriate moment

&gt;The EU is divided and to some extent hesitant about picking a fight with Moscow. **But the US clearly is determined to take a much more activist role.**

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957

Is there really any fucking doubt of American involvement ? It might not have been as extensive (or callous) as in the Orange Revolution, but the State Department sure as hell is worried about Russia.

**And also it this isn't about Bush or Obama, this is a multi-presidential policies**. Post Cold War regime change policies with full American backing have been happening since Clinton. As the article claimed, in the last 20 years.

And in regards to weapon delivery, specially high-tech (drones), Washington knows quite well that they will end up in Moscow's hands sooner or later, as for ""lethal aid"" there is the danger of aggravating an already serious situation, and certainly the ones who will pay is the EU (like the [Libyan refugee crisis](https://consortiumnews.com/2014/08/29/libyas-regime-change-chaos/))"

"To clear up some of the misleading information:

- Evolution is a poor choice of words, especially when contrasted with biological evolution.  The key to evolving is the ability to reproduce, which allows changes to propagate and evolution to take place.  This does not occur with lifeless chemicals, which simply have inherent unchanging physical properties.  Chemicals don't evolve, they just are.

- The balls are called micelles, the membranes are called bilayers, and the hollow shells are called vesicles. Micelles do not combine to form bilayers. Fatty acids will spontaneously assemble to form these structures, but the structure it forms depends on the fatty acid.  Single-tailed fatty acids have a relatively large head area and are typically surfactants that tend to form micelles, whereas two-tailed fatty acids will tend to form bilayers or vesicles.  Vesicles generally require some sort of shear or agitation to self assemble."

I believe a great sleep environment; routine, a darkened room and a whitenoise machine, didn't harm your childs sleep, perhaps it did but it seems unlikely.

"It's surprising given the anti-Islamic backlash that's happened in the wake of 9/11, in spite of efforts to claim that the Al Qaeda interpretation of Islam is somehow heretical. Also, a Muslim who believes in secularism wouldn't be all that different from a Catholic who believes in secularism, but a Muslim theocrat (in the same sense and to the same extent that George Bush was an evangelical theocrat) would be catastrophically bad for free speech, the rights of women, and the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. Meanwhile an atheist is liable to be vehemently live and let live about the whole thing.   
  
Just so I don't leave this hanging, I know you said ""objective morals"" but the cut of your jib implies that atheists don't believe in morality at all, and that's simply not true. We don't believe in morality from a book written by bronze age peasants who didn't know the earth went around the sun. We do believe in the ability of humanity to discover moral truths ourselves, and we furthermore believe that the discovery of moral truth is a much better way to structure a society than the interpretation du jour of a Holy Book. Whatever you say about objectivity, Catholic morality has changed dramatically in the past 500 years, and not because new verses were discovered in the Bible. Do you think Torquemada hadn't read the Sermon on the Mount, or heard the line ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"" It changed because of repeated impacts with rationality forced it to conform to the evolving moral consensus. If it had not, you'd all still be setting old women on fire, accusing them of witchcraft.

"&gt;Referring to women as females is sexist

Just take a moment and actually think. Why, why is it sexist? There has to be a specific reason, you can't just unilaterally label it sexist and therefore it is.

Normally, the argument is that the word is sexist because it is such an unnatural and scientific formulation. That it therefore treats women as objects and denies their personhood through a stilted and clinical word. So the person using it is sexist because either subconsciously or consciously they believe that women aren't people. This is logical argument by which deliberate offense can be ascribed to people who use the word.

However, in this specific case when we are talking about the colloquial use of the word in the rural black community, none of that applies any more. They didn't pick the word up from trying to copy scientific journals. Its not artificial and stilted. Its not intentionally objectifying or deliberately offensive. There's no actual sexist motivation.

I'm not really asking for much here. Just that people understand that different cultures are different and don't jump to insult immediately when there is no basis for it. Again, how hard is to just say ""yeah, I get that you aren't sexist. But as a favor to me, could you use a different word?"" Not hard. Not hard at all."

I'm not saying Superman had any good choices, or options but he literally decided to  commit genocide. "

"The problem with the notion GGG should be intent on making a polished product just has red flags. 

The amount of hype surrounding Act 4 but it becoming a CB left already a bad taste but it wasn't anything that bad. 

But here's where my concerns and problems arise with what has happened thus far. 

Sure GGG is going to have A4 ready and it will probably be solid. The problem is they let people buy into the beta. So effectively even if the final boss is never released in beta , almost all of the A4 related content isn't new and that experience is not lived. The uncertainty and hype of new things is what made the league system work. 

We already know with leagues they start good and die off once most content for players is done. Level up some characters and try out new skills and the related content to that league. But since mostly the majority of act 4 will already be experienced, the leagues that coincide with the official A4 release are going to need to be really good but can we really expect them to pick up the slack when so much effort is currently being pushed on A4?

Beyond and Rampage were leagues that GGG admitted were not given as much work as maybe they should have because Forsaken Masters was the bigger goal and getting them out in a strong way. History tends to repeat itself. 

I know I'm largely being negative and don't seem to have faith at all. Which is the case but it's because I just don't like the way things are adding up. I don't see how the fact beta is this big of an event is not going to affect the official release. The amount of players gained or give PoE a shot once A4 goes official I don't see outnumbering the current playerbase that comes for the new leagues and most of these players will already have been paying attention to all related A4 content or bought their way into the beta themselves. And if the new challenge leagues aren't to higher standards, and the majority of the playerbase is just experiencing the beta officially, then how great is this actually going to be?

I hope things work out better than I currently think they will. But overall, I'm just not hopeful. "

"That thing people keep referencing where women get payed less for the same job is bullshit.

"I think you've got two legitimate things worth addressing futher: that he may have lied to you, and that girls and guys can't be such close friends).  

Otherwise, I think you may be overreacting.

To be honest, it sounds like - with one exception discussed below -- you just don't like her or the fact that another woman is so close to your husband, and you're justifying that after the fact.  

Really, there doesn't seem to be anything improper about their relationship, other than the fact that they're extremely close, and a man and a woman (that might be a well-founded fear, but if so, you should acknowledge *that's* the problem).  It actually sounds like quite a sweet relationship.  The fact that she's best man at his wedding is really a point in favor of them just being friends (if I had a secret love affair with someone, the *last* thing I'd do would be to be happy to make her a best man at my wedding).  

I didn't read any evidence of any current impropriety - basically, i it seemed like someone else doesn't like your fiance's best friend and she's attractive. I think your'e overreacting in worrying that he got drunk with a friend (maybe it's not based in him being bad for it, but that you're worrying he's really fun with her, maybe less so than not with her.  If that's it, sometimes people do cut loose more with their friends, it's not a big deal).  

Two come back to your two legitimate worries, they're 1.) that he lied to you about the nature of their relationship, and 2. ) that he and another woman are very close friends, and that's a sort of sexual time bomb.  

As to 1.), just ask him.  It seems like you trust him and he's been very honest with you.  As to 2.) that's the bigger issue, maybe you're right. But recognize that's what's bothering you, and interrogate whether you think men and women can be close friends without a sexual relationship.  And know that there's two issues here, and it's not just Sandy being a horrible person: a.) men and women can be close friends, and that's what's happening here, or b.) even if they can't, asking your husband to cut off his closest friend is really challenging.  So while you can and should talk to your husband (or objective friends or a counselor), try to remember this. "

How do you think that will happen? 

What's an easier life to you?

&gt;Every morning I wake up and hope today isn't the day our 100 year old plumbing gives out, or for that matter, I hope that we're not hit with any kind of catastrophe, because we cannot afford it. Savings? Nope, nothing left at the end of the month to stash. Investments? Don't make me laugh. Kids? Can't afford them.

And how does that make you different from any other generation? I've experienced everyone one of those complaints. I had no savings until I was 36. I moved to Saudi Arabia for employment and saved and invested 1/3 of my salary. I returned to the USA 7 years later and had to take low paying jobs for in my profession as you usually had to start at the bottom when you changed companies. I remained in the USA for 7 years and left again to the Middle East for employment for another 4 years. All peaches and cream.


I had credit card debt until I was in my 50s. I then was able to pay off my credit card bills when they came in.

I paid off my college student loans from my 4 1/2 years in the military. One can save quite a bit with 2 years in Vietnam, combat pay, flight pay, tax-free income, etc., etc. Where are you going to spend you money in Vietnam? Many spent it on hookers and Saigon Tea. Not me. I had to get another loan when I got out of the service so as to expand my education and didn't pay that off for another 5 years.

I also didn't get married until I was 34 and could afford that life.

And I thought my life was easy for when compared to many others (those of my friends killed in Vietnam for instance) and others who refused to do what I did to get ahead.

"This is fundamentally wrong.  A free country can be defined as one ultimately run by its people, not its government.  And one of the big decisions that a citizenry has to make is whether it will be militaristic or not.

We should salute our soldiers to the extent that we as a people want to do so.  Hopefully we appreciate their sacrifice even if we disagree with the militarism that necessitates it.  But when those ""salutes"" are not authentic expressions of thanks but rather manufactured, then they're not a salute to soldiers at all but just cheap propaganda - and fundamentally wrong. "

"&gt;""Withhold [your tongues] from those who say There is no god but Allah' --- do not call them kafir. Whoever calls a reciter of There is no god but Allah' as a kafir, is nearer to being a kafir himself.''

Nice, but Alawites don't mean that. They say God is the Trinity. They don't understand what Islam means so they never entered it. You can trick westerners to say the shahadah, but it doesn't make them Muslim.

&gt;""Whoever attributes kufr [unbelief] to a believer, he is like his murderer.'' (Tirmizi, ch. Iman (Faith); see Arabic-Urdu edition cited earlier, vol. ii, p. 213. See also Bukhari, Book of Ethics; Book 78, ch. 44)

This refers to people who are already believers.

&gt;According to the Quran, if a person says assalamu alaikum to us to indicate that he is a Muslim, we cannot say to him ""you are not a believer.'' (4:94)

Nice but not really if you read the Qur'an it says:

""O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah , investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace ""You are not a believer,"" aspiring for the goods of worldly life""

It in response to mindless killing of people for worldly gain even though they say peaceful words. Has nothing to do with takfir."

The people who buy these outrageously expensive cables are people who have $50,000 stereos and don't care. To them, when they pay the company to come install their stereo, ""cables"" are an afterthought. They aren't going to the store and picking out $5000 cables off the shelf. "

"&gt; What is this ""anti-competitive gatekeeping"" actually?

Exclusivity.

&gt; Why do you want to ban exclusives?

Because keeping a game locked to one platform (read = unique and replaceable product locked to otherwise unrelated device) is the definition of Gatekeeping. And it is anti-competitive because it forces users to choose a device for the content associated with that device rather than for the features of that device itself.

For example, imagine MS put effort and built the Xbox One to be a thousand times faster, more reliable, and more convenient than the PS4. While Sony just paid out as much money as possible to lock hundreds more great game titles to an inferior device.

Which device would sell more? The PS4.

Why? Because for some freaking reason, the owners of a platform also can control the content available on all platforms.

This does not benefit us as consumer. It does not benefit game developers. It does not push progress. It does not push devices to cheaper prices or cause innovation.

All it does is make MS and Sony and Nintendo want to have more and more exclusives.

&gt; As far as I know, most exclusives games for Playstation are made by studios which are owned by Sony (Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, Sony Santa Monica, Sucker Punch, Media Molecule) and Sony can say that they want games only for their system. I dont see nothing wrong with this. They're paying for production of this games.

Yes, they can do it legally. It's still not Ok because it benefits nobody but the console company at the expense of the consumers and forces us to decide on which product we want based on the content tied to it instead of the the features of the product itself.

&gt; Some people just dont wanna have pc.

I sincerely doubt more than a few thousand people on this earth who have a console are not comfortable on a PC with Windows. If you've gone to school, college, or a workplace that involves using a computer in any way (almost all of them nowadays), you are going to be using a Windows OS.

Most people don't care what they use as long as they get to play games and get the best bang for their buck.

Consoles, as they exist today, are not carving out a niche as they should be, but are using unnecessary blackmail to keep themselves relevant.

Do you remember why consoles were even made in the first place? Because specialization helped distribute PC's. To make a PC back then it would cost an excessive amount of money to make a general PC that was also good for gaming, so some companies branched off and made their own hardware and software specifically for gaming to offset the price to make it reasonable for the consumer.

That sort of specialization is no longer required and no longer beneficial except to a very niche audience. The vast majority of people can make do with a PC that is no cheaper and just as easy to use as a console and still have the joys of a fully multi-tasking device to boot."

"Actually empower the black community to fix its own problems by getting out of the way and stop infantilizing them also stop playing to the criminal element &amp; lazy of the black community, federal dollars are limited any social programs should go to black folks that actually walk the line not criminals and lazy. Consider this the black community has enough economic power, education, and moral conviction in its own community to solve its issues independent of the federal government and its social welfare programs if it wants to. For example lets take the Jewish community a very small community that uses its cultural identity and strengths to overcome massive structural social disadvantages as a group, the same for Asians, Hispanics, the Irish, the Poles, and Roma. The LBJ Great Society has been a huge loser for the black folk e.g. H.S. graduation rates are still low (in some cases even worse) despite spending more on poor blacks kids than poor whites kids, single family homes have grown as a share of the black community no group has organized it self in all of human history and succeed with out a strong family unit, black enterprise like small business creation is less than 30 years ago while Hispanic rates continue to increase the same with Asians, the counter culture movement has devastated a former pillar (a pillar that saw blacks through slavery, sharecropping, jim crow, and the civil rights era) of the black community namely the Church community as a social force, while Hispanics embrace there religious community in record numbers, then the unwillingness to use shame as a tactic for social change in the black community (shame was a strong component that was used to get Whites to abandon slavery, jim crow, and imperialism), allowing one party political rule is a disaster for any society or group and 40+ years of Maryland and Baltimore democratic politics has been a disaster for the Black community also Detroit, please consider that in cities like Dallas, Huston, and Atlanta where there is local Democratic control while state control rests with Republicans creates political balance and Blacks are more ascendant in those area even if they still underperform, then there is the strong criminal element that is allowed to thrive in the black community a parasite that kills it own men at a genocidal level though that pales in compares to the number of black fetuses that are aborted (keeping the black communities numbers very low) thus not as politically relevant as other groups especially Hispanics that are going to be larger than Blacks very soon and way more politically relevant &amp; dynamic, and the biggest the anti-intellectualism is greater in Black America than with redneck trailer trash.

**TL;DR:** Basically get out of the way and let Black America do what it can do so they can go as far as they are capable of and want to go. America owes it to Black folk to stop trying to manage them be it with a whip or welfare line.

"http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/05/04/tomorrow-support-a-safer-upper-market-with-protected-bike-lanes/

&gt;Like on other neighborhood commercial streets, most people don’t get to Upper Market and Castro by driving. As Hoodline reported, a survey Yagedar recently conducted found that along the Upper Market/Castro business corridor, **59 percent of people arrive by foot, 15 percent by transit, 17 percent by car, and 4 percent by bike.**

http://sf.streetsblog.org/2013/03/29/85-percent-of-people-on-polk-street-arrive-without-a-car/

&gt;According to the SFMTA survey report [PDF], agency staff surveyed 410 people on Polk at six locations between Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on a Saturday. Respondents were asked which mode of transport they used to arrive on Polk that day, and which mode they typically used. **In terms of modes typically used, 6.1 percent of respondents came by bike, 15.6 percent by car, 49 percent by foot (though 68 percent walked that day), and 19 percent by transit. The survey also found that “people who drive to Polk likely spend less cumulatively than other visitors.”**

http://sf.streetsblog.org/2014/03/12/irving-transit-bulb-outs-downsized-to-appease-sffd-parking-complainers/

&gt;**Only 22 percent of people in the area arrived by car, while 50 percent walked, 21 percent took Muni, and 5 percent came by bike, according to a field survey of 105 respondents conducted last fall by the City Controller’s Office [PDF].** Those who arrived by car visited the least often — a plurality of them come “less than once the week.” In comparison, a plurality of people who don’t drive to the area said they come “every day” or “about five times a week.” Those who walked reported spending the greatest amount on a weekly basis.

http://sf.streetsblog.org/2013/08/01/geary-brt-plan-watered-down-to-appease-parking-obsessed-merchants/

&gt;**Geary merchants believe that 54 percent of their customers arrive by car, though the actual number is 22 percent, according to a recent SFCTA survey [PDF 1, 2] of 569 businesses on Geary and 295 businesses on Clement Street.** Additionally, shoppers who arrived without cars visited businesses more frequently than those who arrived by car.

Crew survivability might be marginally improved, but the amount of penetrations to the frontal armor of any 3rd generation MBT is a handful, and most are unconfirmed. I suspect that the main reason they moved the crew out of the turret was simply because of the jack in the box effect that plagues Russian tanks when they have catastrophic hits to the turret ring or side armor near the turret ring.

"&gt; Where is your evidence that makes it 100% certain that aliens have to be incomprehensible and that there is literally zero chance that it could be otherwise?

Okay.

1) The burden of proof is on the person making the claim. You are claiming that we can predict with accuracy what alien life is going to be. 

My claim comes after generations of people predicting and claiming what life is supposed to be or going to be on other planets. 

You are essentially saying ""Disprove there isn't an afterlife"".

I am saying that unless we both die (go to space and find it) we have no evidence of the afterlife. Therefore any claims about it or void until evidence showing us what that life can be is found.

Send a probe, send a manned mission, either way the claims are empty unless you have something for us to look at and discuss. You have nothing but hypothesis and wishes. That's it.

&gt; All I'm seeing is a bunch of baseless assumptions. 

2) The irony of this statement hurts.

You're the one making claims that we can know the certainty of how an alien would look, their culture, their planet, etc. 

I am saying that beyond predicting the composition (chemical composition like carbon based or silicon based) the predictions of how an alien evolved or gained intelligence or built a society are all baseless. 

You have to show me the evidence. I don't have to show you anything beyond pointing out the fact your assumptions are coming from science fiction and the fact you want aliens to exist in a certain form. 

""I believe that aliens exist. I believe they have eyes, breathe air, have a government, travel space, and have advanced technology""

Great....now what in your right mind makes you believe that?

""It just seems logical""

Logic is dictated by evidence. The fact we exist doesn't argue against the idea that aliens exist. I don't doubt there are aliens on other planets.

Where I call bullshit is when people make claims about what they are like and how they act. You go that far and you are making baseless claims and stories for entertainment.

Ironically, eating plants does. It's just that people put little to no moral weight on killing plants (except in terms of wider ecological concerns).

Everyone has a spectrum of moral value they place on the world, and everyone draws a line at some point along that spectrum and says, ""I won't kill/eat above this line."" 

You call your line ""unnecessary killing"", but like everyone else, it's a subjective and semi-arbitrary point to choose, predicated on the universal assumption that *your* life is always 100% necessary and that something else must die to sustain it."

"That's why I said it was different in terms of degree.  I also think if you were the one who was tortured it wouldn't really matter if it ""met the standard"".  And there's a tendency for people to excuse bad behavior by pointing out worse behavior elsewhere.  This is not sound logic.  Just because someone did something worse doesn't mean an action isn't worthy of being condemned in it's own right.

Like, hitler wasn't so bad if you compare him to vlad the impaler (or something).

Regardless (and no I don't have a point so much as just rambling now), I actually had a conservative friend around that time who told me (in relation to a very similar discussion at the time) that ""I could see myself getting caught up and supporting Hitler  in prewar germany"".  Yet that didn't cause him any cognitive dissonance.  He admitted that he had so much respect for authority (he was basically an admitted right wing authoritarian) that he could understand the nazis, but didn't see why those motivations were still keeping him on the wrong side of history.

So even if the fervor at that time didn't meet the same standards as in WWII, it was all borne of the same human instincts.  And the parallels were scary, even at the time.  Check out the book on right wing authoritarianism that came out around that time and you'll see what I mean.

On another note, shit was so serious in WWII that I don't think our generation has any true understanding of how lucky we are for things to have turned out like they did, and that we never had to fight a war like that.  I thank my lucky stars on a regular basis.  that shit was awful.  We're a bunch of softies today, and for that I can be grateful."

"&gt; Mayweather won so clearly

I dispute this; it is not a fact.

Floyd really was not accurate in this fight. He missed a lot. Meanwhile he gets credit for his defense, but Pacquiao gets no credit for his defense? In close rounds where Mayweather is just touching Pacquiao, yet Pacquiao turns Floyd's head with his shots, the judges gave them all to Mayweather.

As I keep saying elsewhere, Floyd was given credit for the pace of the fight and thus a pass on his accuracy. Pacquiao was given heat for his low output, thus his defense was ignored and his punches landed counted for less."

"You keep asking me to back this up with science, instead, have an anecdote:

I have personally raised tissue cultured cauliflower to be used as the one parent for hybridized F1 cauliflower. That means that they were all clones, raised in sugar auger, so that their genes would all be these same, so that each ""father"" would create the exact same offspring with a very specific ""mother"", because if they dont, the next generation of commercial cauliflower wont have the appropriate disease resistance.

ALL OF THAT is not GE/GMO, although they did come from Syngenta,so who really knows.

This is just an example of the detailed process it takes to created some of the specialized varieties. Granted my example was cauliflower, but it could have been easily beets or corn or zucchini.
If GE canola comes in, which it cannot because of state, and possibly federal law, it would fuck the whole process.

"You know that the LOTR books as originally written by Tolkien were full of sex and explicit imagery right?  He used to type them out really late at night right before sleeping and originally had no intention to publish the books.  After they were done and he sealed a lucrative publishing contract in the form of three volumes, Tolkien and his son Christopher went through the 6 books and edited out all the sex stuff because it was thought inappropriate for publication at the time.

"The entire world is filled with Timeless Isle-like events. The Apexis daily quest areas are each their own little Timeless Isle, and because everyone on the server gets the same quest at once they had the potential the bring the players together there. So what's the difference? The rewards are not *nearly* as powerful compared to other options as the Timeless Isle rewards were, and the stuff that appealed to explorers and collectors was distributed throughout the entire world instead of concentrated into these daily areas the way it was concentrated on Timeless Isle. On top of that, the addition of the group finder meant when people actually were doing those Apexis daily areas, the path of least resistance was always to join a zerg group from the group finder rather than play on your own server. But the *concept* of the island was taken over to WoD pretty much 1:1, other than those significant flaws.

Your post is actually a really good example of a player seeing a problem but associating something completely unrelated as the ""cause"" of the problem. Garrisons had absolutely nothing to do with the lack of a Timeless Isle-like area or atmosphere in WoD. If you weren't in your garrison, you'd be in the Shrine or Orgrimmar or Dalaran or whatever the capital city of a given expansion was. Feeling *isolated* in your garrison because it's phased for only you is a separate issue than not being ""out in the world"", which already existed to a much lesser extent in previous expansions. 

If the Apexis content was more compelling, either because it had better rewards, or had a collection aspect that could only be completed when it was the active daily zone, rather than just whenever, and if you couldn't xrealm it or there was a compelling reason not to xrealm it (or it was just convenient enough to complete on its own that you didn't even think ""I need to xrealm a big zerg raid to get this done efficiently""), that would be enough to make it ""Timeless Isle"" status.

"&gt;Genausowenig Nazi wie die SPD, CDU und Grünen (kennst Du sicher unter dem Namen ""Systemparteien""), die alle die de facto existierende, kontrollierte Zuwanderung vertreten und mittragen. Du hast wohl den Asylkompromiss von '92 verschlafen. Aber klar sieht das deine Stammpartei AfD alles etwas anders. Die sehen ganz viele Sachen ganz seltsam und anders, als sie wirklich sind.

Mit Sarkasmus hast du es nicht so, oder?

Derartige Äußerungen werden von Linken für gewöhnlich mit ""Sozialdarwinismus"" und ""Nützlichkeitsrassismus"" abgefertigt und als Beweis für eine ""menschenverachtende Gesinnung"" gesehen.

Und welche ""kontrollierte Zuwanderung"" bitte?

Seit Schengen kommt hier alles und jeder rein und kaum jemand wird abgeschoben. Staatsbürgerschaften werden inflationär verteilt und die ständige Mär vom ""Fachkräftemangel"", der nur mit Masseneinwanderung ausgeglichen werden kann ist auch noch ganz groß.

Kanada und Australien haben kontrollierte Zuwanderung, hier rufen die Leute ""gekommen um zu bleiben"" und die Sache ist erledigt.

&gt;Das bringt der Immobilienmarkt und der Zufall. Viele freie, preiswerte Immobilien auf dem bevölkerungsarmen Land und wenig freie, preiswerte Häuser im bevölkerungsreichen Städtischen.

Ach, tun sie das?

Deswegen werden wohl auch regelmäßig Hotels, Krankenhäuser und Pflegeheime in Innenstädten vom Staat gekauft und in Flüchtlingsheime umgewandelt, während die besseren Viertel verschont bleiben oder wie?

Hamburg Harvestehude sollte ja auch ein Flüchtlingsheim bekommen, Bauarbeiten hatten auch schon begonnen. Dann haben sich die Anwohner (durchgehend obere Mittelklasse) beschwert und Sorgen geäußert, dass mit den Flüchtlingen Drogen, Gewalt und Wertverlust der Grundstücke kommt und plötzlich war es ein ""besonders geschütztes Wohngebiet"". 

Ansonsten ist man sich ja auch nicht zu fein Eigentum zu beschlagnahmen und umzuwandeln oder für Wucherpreise runtergewirtschaftete Anlagen zu kaufen. Das hat weder was mit Märkten noch mit Zufall zu tun, man bringt die da unter, wo man meint den Widerstand leicht brechen zu können.

&gt;Du müsstest nur mal rational nachdenken, aber wahrscheinlich glaubst Du deine ideologische Agitation selber noch. Pass auf, dass Du Dich nicht mal daran verschluckst.

Mit rationalem Denken ist die deutsche Politik schon lange nicht mehr nachzuvollziehen...

&gt;Warum wir Menschen nicht über den Umgang mit Minderheiten abstimmen lassen? Wahrscheinlich aus dem selben Grund wieso im GG Minderheitenschutz und Asylrecht verankert ist. Aber hey, warum fragen wir die Menschen nicht, wie viele Steuern sie zahlen wollen? Welche Gesetze sie wollen und was die Bundeswehr gerade macht? Weil Menschen keine Berufspolitiker sind und daher Basisdemokratie nur eng begrenzt funktioniert. Deine Baits sind manchmal so grottenschlecht.

Och, in der Schweiz scheint es doch auch ganz gut zu funktionieren.

Und ""Minderheitenschutz"" heißt nicht, dass man in deren Namen schalten und walten kann, wie man will. Im Gegenteil, die Wut auf die völlig rücksichtslose Asylpolitik der Bundesregierung wird auf genau jene projeziert, denen sie nützen soll. 

Wem bitte ist damit geholfen, wenn man Anwohnern ein Flüchtlingsheim aufzwingt, das niemand will? Die Flüchtlinge sind unwillkommen und das lässt man sie auch spüren. Und wenn es dabei bleibt, ist es noch relativ harmlos. Wenn die Flüchtlinge dann allerdings auch noch unangenehm auffallen (was sich bei radikal unterschiedlichen Kulturen und Wertvorstellungen kaum vermeiden lässt) ist es eine Frage der Zeit, bis die Anwohner die Dinge in die selbst in die Hand nehmen.

&gt;Aber dann müssen solche Straftäter auch mit Strafe rechnen. Ist simpelst.
Abgesehen davon, bist Du -nach Krawall- nicht der notorischste Anti-Antifa-Propagandist den /r/de je gesehen hat? ""Man kann den Menschen auch xyz aufzwingen, aber dann muss man halt mit Gewalt rechnen""? So fühlt sich der schwarze Block sicher auch. Voll unterdrückt vom System, deshalb Krawall. Legitim.

Der Unterschied ist der, dass der linke Terror weitestgehend von offiziellen Stellen toleriert wird. Unsere allseits beliebte Familienministerin hat ja auch verlautbaren lassen, dass Linksextremismus ein ""aufgebauschtes Problem"" sei und direkt die Extremismusklausel und die Aussteigerprogramme für Linksextremisten eingestellt. 

Wenn linksextreme Gentrifizierungsgegner frisch renovierte Bauten verwüsten, die Bewohner terrorisieren und ""Schwaben raus"" brüllen, weil sie um ""ihren Kiez"" kämpfen, ist das kaum eine Erwähnung in der Lokalzeitung wert.

Wenn rechtsextreme Asylgegner Asylantenheime verwüsten, die Bewohner terrorisieren und ""Ausländer raus"" brüllen, tauchen direkt Polizei, Presse und Verfassungsschutz auf."

Sorry but even if you're right, I'd say things are awkward when both sides feel weird about something; being offered a regular pizza as a vegan will be labeled as being picky/difficult.

"What IS  a good reason to get a JD.  Not prejudice just curious.  My first degree is actually in music and I then worked in corporate accounting in a real estate company (btw I know real estate also quite well) after getting an accounting diploma and I found out how much I liked it.  I thought about getting an MBA and someday become the next Steve Jobs.  But I decided to get a CPA first and I did a masters degree to qualify for it.  I forgot why I chose tax over MBA, but I think it is mainly because I also read business books and I just thought that MBA materials get repetitive.  So as you can see that I have also been curious about different subjects and pursued studies in those subjects that I find interesting.  As I mentioned in my previous posts, of course I would pursue JD for the money.  But I do like reading law (other than criminal law).  But I am indeed curious why most people study law school anyway.   Obama and the Clintons went to law school after studying politics as undergrads.  Do most people go in for the money?  Even I do like reading law (and politics as a very passionate Democrat), I think most peope like me are thinking to get JD as their golden tickets to winning the game of life, or sometimes as it turns out, a lottery ticket.

Sure he's smart, and is a great shooter in practice, and is a nice dude, but he cannot compete against NBA level talent.

For his career he averages 41% from 3 in the regular season, and 35% during the playoffs. This means in the playoffs, he shrinks from being an elite shooter to being below the league average. On top of that he had the worst shooting year of his career in the playoffs and second worst in regular season.

He was useful when Pop started him against the Thunder in '14, because Brooks considered him a threat for some reason. Compare that to, again, using him to stretch the floor against the Clippers, who actually have a good coach, and you get to watch him shoot 22% from deep while being left unguarded, sometimes with no one within 15 feet of him. 

Put him in the office if you want him around (it's not like he can be a coach with that horrendous shot form, even if it does work in the gym), if he wants to play basketball, wish him luck and hang up the phone.

"Like the zero sum game of modern relationships with western women has become, so also is the entire paradigm of dating a western woman. Essentially as a man you're obligated to provide a series of free drinks, movies and drinks, gifts and other sacrificial services in the hope of earning a relationship with a woman who is under absolutely no obligation to reciprocate in any way, and any mentions that she should is typically met by the shrill feminist indictment that doing so is yet another example of evil men pushing his sexist entitlement for sex on the objectified woman. 

His only recourse within the gynocentric paradigm of relationships with a western woman is to submit to the role of mindless deference and self sacrifice to an entitle-minded woman who only sees you as an exploitable resource to  emotionally and psychologically manipulate until there's nothing left, at which point he's casually discarded with utmost prejudice.

Don't like it and say so, then the feminist will point and scoff that you're bitter and a loser who got rejected. Then if you refrain from dating, the same misandrist feminist will quickly charge you with being immature and afraid of commitment to a so-called strong independent woman. Of course her behavior will never be examined nor her culpability ever be called into question. hence all the articles and books proclaiming men who refuse to exist as an exploited disposable utility as losers who refuse to grow up or cling to video games and the whole pantheon of blame for which his character is conflated to the sum total of negative associations culminating in loser, sexist and yes childish.

It becomes easy to see the pattern once the red pill enlightenment allows you to see the subtext and underlying reality behind the feminist belittlement of men who stop dating. And it is this. The paradigm of modern dating is formatted to prevent the man from feeling an real sense of personal self esteem, or sense of independent value. Nothing in the feminist rhetoric on the subject of dating and modern relationship promotes anything like self esteem for men, but instead a steady ongoing existence of hoping from one foot to the other in a ridiculous dance of ""How do I make her feel satisfied and happy?"" The answer is NOTHING. The paradigm  of modern dating shifts rules, expectations, randomly changes from one standard to the other, always in service of requiring more and more evidence of a man's devotion and affection through increasingly expensive acts of demeaning degradation and  humiliation. One need only watch a mainstream movie, comedy or drama to see this paradigm in play.

When MGTOWS end the free ride, and spend their hard earned money on themselves, its amazing how quickly one can gain personal self esteem and a sense of real value when  its no longer left up to women and feminist to define the terms of your self worth and what validates your happiness."

This study is so flawed it's not even funny
"Bortser man nu från varukropparnas bruksvärde, så återstår dem endast en egenskap, nämligen att vara arbetsprodukter. Emellertid har även arbetsprodukten redan förvandlats under våra händer. Bortser vi från dess bruksvärde, då bortser vi också från de kroppsliga beståndsdelar, som gör den till ett bruksvärde. Det är inte längre fråga om bord eller hus eller garn eller något annat nyttigt ting. Arbetsproduktens hela struktur är utplånad. Nu är det inte heller fråga om en produkt av snickararbete eller byggnadsarbete eller spinneriarbete eller eljest av något bestämt produktivt arbete. Med arbetsproduktens nyttokaraktär försvinner också nyttokaraktären av de däri representerade arbetena, och samtidigt försvinner de olika konkreta formerna av dessa arbeten, vilka nu inte längre går att skilja från varandra utan alla är reducerade till ett och samma mänskliga arbete, till abstrakt mänskligt arbete.
Låt oss betrakta arbetsprodukternas residuum. Ingenting annat återstår av dem än en och samma spöklika verklighet: en utkristallisering av odifferentierat mänskligt arbete, d.v.s. förbrukning av mänsklig arbetskraft utan hänsyn till formen för dess förbrukande. Dessa ting uttrycker nu endast ett: att vid dess produktion mänskligt arbete förbrukats och mänskligt arbete anhopats. Såsom kristaller av denna för dem alla gemensamma, samhälleliga substans utgör de värden - varuvärden.
I själva utbytesförhållandet mellan varorna syntes oss deras bytesvärde vara alldeles oavhängigt av deras bruksvärden. Bortser man nu verkligen från arbetsprodukternas bruksvärde, så erhåller man deras värde, såsom det just nu bestämdes. Det gemensamma, som framträder i utbytesförhållandet eller i varans bytesvärde, är alltså dess värde. Undersökningens fortgång skall föra oss tillbaka till bytesvärdet såsom värdets nödvändiga uttryckssätt eller manifestationsform; men först och främst är dock värdet att betrakta oberoende av denna form.
Ett bruksvärde eller en nyttighet har alltså ett värde, endast därför att abstrakt mänskligt arbete däri har blivit förkroppsligat, materialiserat. Hur mäter man då storleken av dess värde? Genom den mängd ""värdebildande substans"", som däri innehålles, av arbetet. Arbetskvantiteten själv mätes med dess utsträckning i tiden, och arbetstiden åter har sitt mått i bestämda tidsenheter, timmar, dagar o.s.v.
Om värdet av en vara bestämmes av den under produktionen förbrukade arbetsmängden, kan det synas, som om en vara skulle bli desto värdefullare, ju latare och oskickligare dess tillverkare är, enär han har behövt så mycket mer tid för dess förfärdigande. Men det arbete, som bildar värdenas substans, är samma mänskliga arbete, förbrukandet av en och samma mänskliga arbetskraft. Samhällets sammanlagda arbetskraft, som yttrar sig i varumarknadens värden, gäller här som en och samma mänskliga arbetskraft, ehuru den består av otaliga individuella arbetskrafter. Var och en av dessa individuella arbetskrafter är samma mänskliga arbetskraft som varje annan, såvitt den äger karaktären av en samhällelig genomsnittsarbetskraft och alltså vid produktionen av en vara endast behöver använda den i genomsnitt nödvändiga eller samhälleligt nödvändiga arbetstiden. Samhälleligt nödvändig arbetstid är den arbetstid, som behövs för att framställa ett bruksvärde under föreliggande, samhälleligt normala produktionsbetingelser och med samhällelig genomsnittsgrad av skicklighet och intensitet i arbetet. Efter ångvävstolens införande i England t.ex. blev kanske hälften så mycket arbete tillräckligt för att förvandla ett givet kvantum garn till väv. Den engelske handvävaren behövde i själva verket för denna förvandling samma arbetstid som förr. Men produkten av hans individuella arbetstimme utgjorde nu inte mer än en halv samhällelig arbetstimme och gav därför endast hälften av det tidigare värdet."

It doesn't matter *at all* if this leads to some ridiculous consequence according to a crazy counterexample; it is already the state of the world. If you're argument were valid, your counterexample--killing one to save seven billion--could be just as easily used to show that the prohibition on murder is absurd, since in this hypothetical the law would lead to the death of billions. Obviously that's not a good reason to make murder legal.

And we *have* agreed on social ethical boundaries. No one said that they don't change over time. In fact, my *whole argument* rests on the fact that they do change over time.

"Here is [**ZetaTalk**'s](http://zetatalk.com) explanation for it:


&gt;Where initially only a hum, and only in certain notorious parts of the world, rock under stress has become noisy. Known as the [Taos hum](http://zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue155.htm), the sound of a diesel engine running somewhere underground was an early entry. Then the Seattle drums entered the arena, rhythmic booming which was ascribed to flapping manhole covers. Booms from snapping and heaving rock were reported in the New Madrid region and humming along the St. Lawrence Seaway [increased](http://zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue089.htm).

&gt;But in 2011, it became clear that where we predicted that the [Earth would moan](http://zetatalk.com/poleshft/p101.htm) during the 5.9 days of rotation stoppage, it was not going to be silent between then and now. The [trumpets of Kiev](http://zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue255.htm) and the horns of Belarus went viral on the Internet, followed quickly by a [roar over Tampa Bay](http://zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue257.htm) that sounded like Godzilla emerging from the sea. Now, in early 2012, this has spread to the drums of Costa Rica and the howl of Alberta and the Borneo snore.

&gt;Where is this leading? At least half the Earth, at any given point in time, will be having some sort of tension in its rock. Clapping and grinding fault lines, vibrating bodies of water, trembling rock strata resisting being pulled apart, and snapping rock under compression or being bent. All will be noisy, and the most likely reaction among those who hear it will be to conclude that the End Times have arrived. However known in various cultures around the world, allhave some reference to the coming times. **The establishment will be unable to explain away these sounds, and once again the Internet will be sought and will lead inevitably to our explanations.**

"&gt;The general push back from feminist groups have made the majority of this sub anti-feminist. Many members of this sub once called themselves feminist so it would not be accurate to dismiss them as not understanding it.

Yeah, definitely. But I do feel like this sub has been making slow progress towards people understanding the difference between feminism and radical feminism. And obviously you have to make this distinction for yourself, they won't do it for you.

I think it's important that the reasonable people from both sides can eventually come together and just preach equality between genders. It won't be easy though, because we all tend to want issues that personally affect us to be addressed first. Sometimes it blinds people into becoming irrational unfortunately. 

Anyways, my point is, let's try and keep this subreddit moving towards an Egalitarian mindset, and distance ourselves from radical MRAs. Even on Reddit it seems people laugh off this subreddit as being radical MRAs from what I've seen, but I know there's a lot of people here that are a lot better than that. That's why I'm still here.


edit: Can't say I'm surprised this didn't get any upvotes. As I said, we've made progress, but there's a reason Reddit hates people from this subreddit. A lot of you are intolerant, and don't really care about other causes, only your own. It's fine, one day we'll get there.

"Not exactly, since Japanese and to a lesser degree Chinese people usually have piss-poor phonemic awareness, which means they won't be so good at swapping out single phonemes in a word.  (Japanese people's sound-based writing system is syllabic, and that is how Japanese people think about speech. Chinese-speaking people almost all know some form of romanization, usually Pinyin, or other transcription system, so they can think in terms of phonemes, but aren't used to using phonemes except in very specific combinations.)  

The way puns usually work in Japanese, and pretty much always work in Chinese, is that they'll change out a character for one that sounds the same but means something different.  In the case of Chinese, the words for ""fap"" don't share any sounds with the words for ""happening,"" so no, probably it wouldn't happen.  I'm pretty sure the same is true in Japanese, though Japanese is more amenable to portmanteaus, so there might be some way to stick ""onani"" and ""okoru"" together that'd work.  Still wouldn't carry the same sort of humor."

"Remember that we as human beings evolved for breast milk to be the only food for newborns. So if you couldn't breastfeed your baby your genetic material would not be passed on. People who physically can't breastfeed got weeded out of the gene pool. That is why the percent of women who physically cannot breastfeed is really quite small.

I'm not saying anyone is superior, but rather it is misleading to say breastfeeding and formula are equal because the scientific consensus is that they are not. "

This has been discussed over and over before on Reddit. Google is your friend.
"&gt; You continue to ignore the point. Why are men and women not allowed to touch each other?

So from why can't men touch women to why cant we both touch each other. We can touch each other. We can touch Mahrams. We don't touch non-mahrams because we extend them respect and courtesy. You might be OK with your female family members getting patted down by men, But I or my family members wouldn't want anyone to lay their hands on us. 

&gt; Indeed, because that could leed to erotic feelings and sex. This is sexualizing the presence of opposite genders.

You see what you did there, before it was all about muslims sexualizing women, how dare they, they just think women are sexual objects, now that you pick up on more Islam, its muslims sexualizing everybody. Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, they coming to sexualize everybody

"Except the things you are saying is the story are the things he gave up in the first iron man. He gave up excesses to settle down with Pepper, the capitalism and corruption was his partner as part of the weapon company, who he literally killed and changed from weapons to clean energy. The same partner that tried to kill him out of greed. 

So you can argue he benefited from them, but he left it behind and changed direction, hence not who he is. The character we see on screen is someone who had all that and was willing to give it all up to become Iron Man. It's literally his character arc in the first movie. Hence it's a bit of a stretch to say it's what he represents when his introduction and a whole movie is him moving away from that. "

"1. Of course we can when it is their choices and their failure to live up to societies rules that has caused them to have no value.  If they done acts so heinous that we have decided they will never have a place in society, that is entirely different than having empathy for those that are victims of circumstance.  Apples and oranges.

2. I agree if the point is rehabilitation.  But someone that is merely being placed in storage away from society is not entitled to this. 

3. Inherent value is a tricky thing that can go all over, but saying someone else has value defensively for the sake of someone possibly questioning your own value at some point on the future is not an argument for a persons value or lack there of.  It may be the most self serving opinion to hold, but that does not create value in a condemned persons life.

And there is a difference from someone who is a part of society or at least is not a threat to the people that are, and someone who has committed an act that deprived someone else of their well-being to such an extent that society has decided they can never again be trusted to have access to society.  Whether that person is killed or locked away forever, their inherent value to society is absolutely less than the average persons, the elderly, the handicapped or anyone elses.

"Glad I didn't have to be the one to say it. I can understand not allowing huge redstone structures that could easily cause lag, but getting rid of anything automatic because you yourself may consider it ""cheaty"" isn't fair. Minecraft is a sandbox game, so you do what you enjoy doing.  Banning what others may find fun because it's against your personal reasons isn't something you do in such a game. The server use to take a lot of pride in being a vanilla server, but banning things you can do in vanilla Minecraft is more like a watered down version of it. This bothers me a lot because some of the most fun I have in MC is making automatic farms. Gives me time to work on neat projects for the server. So having something I enjoy doing being restricted, makes me feel restricted as a whole on the server. Instead of seeing the server as a place to have fun in my own way, I have to have fun how others allow me to. I've been around since the server opened, and I'm really worried about where it's now heading. I can understand there's a lot of stress, having to wipe the map and still having some problems, but this isn't the way to go about it. I love the community and made some close friends, and would hate to start disliking the server. But if it keeps getting stricter, it may come to that. If there really is a bigger reason for this, like just trying to test something, I would be more than happy to hear it. "

This teaches players that if they want to climb they must train and be good at 3-4 roles. In turn they also become more experienced with that diversity. With ranked team builder this allows people to play one role only. This system is ONLY in place to combat trolls.

&gt;  ""TB ranked will probably be separate""

"&gt; a place with ""yes means yes"" consent laws.

In other words, a college campus in California? Even then, the [California statute](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967) changes only the colleges' internal policies, not the applicable criminal law. In other words, people can be kicked-out of school for failure to get a ""yes,"" but they can't be criminally prosecuted and sent to jail unless there's an actual ""no."" At least, that's *my* reading of the law; if someone else has more experience w/ this statute and wants to argue differently, go nuts.

As far as I am aware, there is no jurisdiction anywhere in the United States where affirmative consent is the applicable rule. (New York has a sexual-assault misdemeanor that *sort of* uses a yes-means-yes standard, but even there, nonverbal cues can establish affirmative consent.)"
"&gt; These are problems in most major cities

Haha most major cities have the foresight to have sidewalks and ban scooters from sidewalks.  Also, visiting practically any US city seems like a ghost town compared to Taipei.  Even Manhattan felt much more spacious despite being technically denser, maybe because they have real sidewalks that aren't covered in 5 different kinds of bullshit.

&gt; The apartments aren't so shitty if you can pay for it.

I got an expensive apartment at one point in a nice new building and it turned out that the build was apparently made of cardboard and was the noisiest fucking place and everything broke all the time.

Your choices in Taipei are essentially tiny old concrete shitboxes, or new construction that is put together hastily with extremely poor quality and shortcuts taken at every turn.  And the more I look, the more I am displeased with the quality of housing available in Taipei at any price point.

&gt; Mold is a symptom of a really shitty apartment and lack of a dehumidifier.

Maybe Taiwan could benefit from central air that keeps apartments out of the temperature ranges that breed mold?"

"The point is that with atheism, people believe that humans are fundamentally good, and that the problems in society come from external factors, such as greed, which comes from property ownership. The solution is to get rid of property ownership, so that no one can have greed. The result is that the government has to take control for a while so that people can get used to not owning property. However, when the people lose their property, the government owns everything, and when the government owns everything, nothing good comes as a result, which is fundamentally why getting rid of religion is nonsensical. It all stems from the assumption that humans are good fundamentally. If you misidentifying the problem, you misidentify the solution."

When men don't get everything that they hoped for from nonmonogamy, they shouldn't come here to whine. Instead, they should take their disappointment as an opportunity to reflect upon the vast and unearned privilege that they enjoy in all aspects of life, including dating.

"&gt;  The reason racism is bad is because of the effects it has.

Not everyone is a consequentialist. For example

&gt;So if you're going to reduce racism to ""making an observation or statement based solely on a person's phenotype"" then why is that bad? The only reason it could be bad necessitates the move to distinguishing between prejudice and racism.

This is quite the jump. A deontologist could say that it's bad because it disvalues people as ends in themselves. A virtue ethicist could say that it fails to display compassion. And in fact, for anyone who isn't a consequentialist, which is many people, the consequences of it are totally irrelevant. Virtue ethics in particular judges actions almost entirely on the basis on what they say about the actor, nothing else even enters the picture. And so under such an analysis prejudice and racism can quite easily come out looking equally bad.

Edit: And I'd point out that making such a distinction doesn't get you anywhere in terms of establishing ""badness"". Like every other ethical system to date, you still fall prey to the open question argument. I can accept the truth of everything else you've said and *still* ask ""But why does that make it worse?""."

"Alright, you really dropped a massive link. I actually tried reading some. It is obviously my bias coming through, but I don't think businesses in the USA would be thrilled at the prospect of their employees disappearing for months and months and needing to watch children at work etc. I read an example in the study of an owner with 20% of their workforce missing because of pregnancy and more of their employees actively planning to get pregnant.

I admit that would give me sleepless nights as an employer.

The culture in the USA is very work oriented and money driven. I am not saying it is better, just different.

I think the businesses that want to be more flexible already voluntarily are doing it along with other things like flexible schedule or even working from home etc. "

"&gt;Is what he's saying about the images being misrepresented, is that true?
    
It's deflection. There are plenty of pictures from the actual protests taking place, so when that haji focusses on that aspect it is an extremely disingenuous method of trying to say that there aren't any protests going on. There's no real reason to use pictures from the '09 protests - unless the website using them is attempting to paint a time-line of protests.
    
&gt;About what he's saying about the destruction of property &amp; especially evidence, is that true? What evidence do you have that the regime (a regime, I remind you, I am certainly not sympathetic to) is responsible for this rape?
    
These questions are irrelevant because there is no justice in Iran, even less for Kurds and even less than that for Kurdish women. Any evidence that was there could as easily be discarded. Again, this is a straw-man and a disingenuous attempt at white-washing the issue and placing blame on the protestors for ""destroying evidence"".
    
&gt;I have seen your rhetoric before, my black friends who condemned the race riots were told they ""act white."" With respect, this looks to be something very similar.
    
Except the situation with Kurds in Iran is completely different. You can't compare them, since there are actual regime agents all over trying to play a PR game to make the regime look good, especially on internet forums. 
    
Edit: Here's my point being proven concerning hajisanandaji(btw, his name gives him away, you tell me how many Kurds call themselves haji? I can tell you that we don't and the religious extremists are more prone to do so. In Kurdish culture we have Khans, not hajis), this is what he recently posted in /r/iran:

My dad kept staring at her. The teenager would keep looking and my dad would be staring every time. When the teenager had had enough, she sarcastically asked, “Whats the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?”

Knowing my dad, I quickly swallowed my food so I wouldn’t choke on his response — I knew he would have a good one.

In classic style he responded without batting an eyelid: “Got stoned once and fucked a parrot. Just wondering if you were my daughter.”""

It's literally in the [first flag of ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China_\(1912-1928\).svg). The five races are equal and united, at least that's the idea.

Now comes the PRC, literally any group that had any difference could be considered an ethnicity by the government. Many groups that previously considered Manchus, Mongols, ""Muslims"" and sometimes Han are now belong to new ethnicities. Great right? Except that even with ""affirmative action"" of sorts, Han is still the overwhelming majority (90+%) of the population. While the ethnic minorities are now divided into 55 different groups.

"&gt;stop making excuses.

There is no excuse for the violence that does plague the black community, but don't be under any illusion that MOST black people are criminals. Because that is idiotic and facts prove that it is untrue. There are a TOTAL of 2.2 million prisoners in the US. There are 45,000,000 African Americans. Last time I checked 2.2 isn't half or 45, it's not even close. And the number of prisoners that are black is slightly less than half of the 2.2 million. 

Maybe you should learn the difference between excuse and explication. An excuse would be saying there is no violence problem in the black community and white people are just crazy. THAT is an excuse. I don't recall saying anything that is even remotely similar to that. 

Stop being a closed minded fool."

We give £10m per day t the EU and whilst there are a lot of positives I don't think they're worth that much. Other than free trade (which could continue if we left EU as we export more than we import anyways) the negatives outweigh the positives. Net migration last year was 300,000 which means in the last 2 years the UK has gained over half a million people! A ridiculously unsustainable amount. I'm all f immigration but if the numbers don't get controlled (by changing EU free borders policy) then the country is gonna suffer major over population issues. Also since joining the EU, immigration from non EU countries, including Commonwealth countries, has been capped which I think is very unfair.
Also the EU Human rights act stops dangerous, foreign criminals like terrorists and such being deported meaning we have no choice but t keep them here even if their presence endangers citizens."

"It might sound fucking bat shit crazy, but here me out. I really don't think any of this has to do with child molesting.

Josh was 14 or 15 years old when he molested the young girls, but I don't think you can treat him as a 14 or 15 years old because he (or anybody else in this family) were never taught anything about their sexuality. So, when he first started getting ""feeling"" he probably thought this is sin this is wrong, and he couldn't go to anyone. Plus, he has little to no contact with any girls other then his younger sisters. It was a recipe for diaster. Everyone must remember that when this happened he confessed to his parents, he was displinced and was put in therapy to teach him this is wrong. He even told his now wife what had happened. What the issue is in my mind is, was the same opprotinuity given to the girls? Were they given help? Probably not. So, yes I do think they are being harsh on Josh Duggar because he essentially was still a child, and you can't expect a child to know these things if they are never taught. I really think more attention should be given to the bigger issue of what are the parents doing make sure this never happens again, and did the parents make sure that the daughters involved in this situation were giving the help that they deserve. 

TLDR; Way too much attention is given to making Josh Duggar a monster, too little attention is given to the daughters making sure that they are okay."

"To all the people crying and whining about how Mayweather was ""running"" from Pacquiao, you're all sore idiots. As a hardcore Manny fan who literally prayed before the fight that Manny would knock Floyd's teeth out, I have to admit that Mayweather is the best fighter of our generation. He ""ran"" from Manny and scored precise punches for the first couple rounds and then in the later rounds when Manny was getting real reckless he really went after Manny because he knew the fight was sealed. This is strategy - pure, flawless strategy executed to perfection. Give the man the respect he deserves. And it wasn't boring by any means, it was a good fight."

Not the best for PC recordings, but overall I am very happy with them. I suggests going with the PC/PS4 version and not the ones classified as Xbox One. Those come with a mixamp that attaches on the controller and just isn't the best. The PC/PS4 comes with the normal mix amp and works with pretty much all devices. It has a toslink optical cable in, USB in, and a 3.5 mm cable in. It's an amazing audio device on top of the amazing headset.

The quality of policing and firefighting will *not* increase by paying police officers and firefighters $100k/yr any more than paying a garbageman $100k/yr would increase the quality of garbage disposal. If the current police officers and firefighters in Providence don't want to work for what's being offered, they can quit and somebody equally qualified will replace them by the end of the week. Police work and firefighting are blue collar jobs that literally any monkey can do after a year in either the police or fire academy.

I'm ""negative"" because I disagree with you? Eat a dick. There's nothing negative about holding the position that public servants in Providence should be paid less."

"hi, i'm new to reddit and this is my first comment. i'm from iran. i mean i was born here in iran but i really hate it here.
for a tourist (i guess) like yourself there are still some good and interesting attractions left here in this country...
there are still some friendly and warm people left in the villages (specially kurdish villages) that will serve you delicious local food and milk and bread and yogurt for free...
there are still some nice scenery and natural attractions and historic landmarks left in not too bad conditions around the country...
but other than that, the rest is almost completely waste of time in my opinion.
now i couldn't read your profile, i'm new here i just clicked on your username and couldn't find any info about you, i guess reddit doesn't give the option to write a profile about yourself.
but i'm interested to know where you are from and why did you choose iran and are you male or female because that makes a lot of difference!!!
if you are a woman i highly recommend that you don't travel here alone or with a group of your girlfriends.
any way, i live in the most north western part of the country and i see that it's not on your travel plan to visit these parts but if you somehow get a chance to come close to this region i would recommend checking out this human-made natural disaster in the making:

"&gt;Unless you know exactly what you're getting into with Linux then you're going 
&gt;to have to buy Windows. Unless all of your software runs on Linux, you're 
&gt;going to have to buy Windows.

Isn't the inverse true as well (except for the ""buy"" part)?

&gt;I love Linux, and Linux is great and all, but it's really limited compared to 
&gt;Windows. 

Ok, you need to expand on that. Honestly, on paper, it's quite the opposite (including running on far more and older hardware, giving the user more control and more options, etc.). In fact, Windows 8 and especially 10 are borrowing hand over fist from Linux (and to a lesser extent OS X)... an (eventual) copy-on-write file system, package management, the option of frequent updates, multiple desktops, a rolling release model, etc. - even giving away a release for free. :-) Even the latest Windows server started dropping its GUI/wizard management and made controlling systems via shell and web interface the new standard.

If I were to install stock standard OpenSUSE on a PC, you get a complete office suite (word processor, database, spreadsheet, graphing, presentation), PIM suite (e-mail, calendar, contacts, RSS Feed, notes, etc.), a ""micro-blogging client"" (update social media from one program), an IRC client, a bittorrent client, a VoIP client, Photoshop-like editor, image manager, RAW camera image editor, music/media manager, media player (including TV tuner), mapping software, PDF/document/ebook viewer, archiver, Flash, codecs (after main install), disk burner, download manager, browser, clipboard manager, scanning software, HDR and panorama picture creator, and a few other utilities. There are many more you can choose before install from the disk (and of course you can add software afterwards). Anyway, this ""stock"" install gives the average user all they really need. They can surf the web, update their Facebook page, rip CDs, burn disks, play music, edit pictures, manage/tag photos, get directions, talk online, send e-mail, write a document, do their home budgets, watch Netflix, play a video file... everything. And it takes *less than 4GB*. Windows takes about 12GB and you get next to nothing out of the box (Windows couldn't even natively open a PDF before 8). 

On top of that, Windows limits you in terms of choice and control (including the #*#@ Windows 8 tiled interface being forced onto the desktop). 

&gt;That and I'd wager that a hefty chunk of people who build computers are 
&gt;gamers, which means that Windows is the de facto OS of choice since 
&gt;there just isn't the availability of games on Linux at the moment. 

There are quite a lot now and the WINE compatibility layer runs most except for some of the newest. I still think it's a choice rather than a necessity. I know it's not your intention, but this has been a subversive argument for some time... a suggestion that Linux just isn't ready as an operating system (hence no need to actually compare or consider it). In 2015, Windows, OS X and Linux are all viable operating systems capable of functioning as stable and powerful desktop OSes. One can have one's own needs and preferences and choose between them, but other than corner cases most people don't need/have to choose a particular one.

"pizza hut is just as horrible as ISIS, probably worse. probably contributed to more health problems as well. pizza hut is a terrible corporation selling poison to children and families all the while marketing it as something to vastly improve human lives. so not only does pizza hut contribute to more health problems than isis, it does so in a more insidious and deceitful way. not to forget to mention the millions of dollars of donations they make to politicians in order to make sure they can continue to gain the approval of the FDA, to make us all beleive pizza hut is a good thing.


ISIS started as a small group in the middle east fighting for power since there is no government. they get weapons from the united states and are allowed to thrive because of us. then when they get ttoo powerful we blame THEM and kill everyone over there. they use US weapons to gain power in a place where no goverment is allowed to succeed becauase the united states keeps them powerless, destitute, disenfranchised and stupid. 


so how is pizza hut better than ISIS?"

"So, I feel there are 2 sides to this.

The one side is, yes, there are some really douchey people out there who deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  


However, the other side is this to me:

How in the world can the people making this game not understand that whenever you subject yourself and your work to the public, that not only this is the risk you run part and parcel to the job of running such a successful public entity, but also that you should not be taking out the actions of the FRINGE out on your HARDCORE SUPPORTERS, if in dollars only?

Eric had me on his side during his post the whole way...until he threatened the community with developer silence.
And unfortunately, this seems to be common to gaming companies when you look at ""gamergate"".

What sucks is you look at other successful companies in other avenues of business, and the good ones ARE smart enough to NOT lump crazies in with their general purchasing base.

In fact, they don't even acknowledge them (because it can empower more to do the same) - they instead prosecute them behind the scenes while maintaining an open public face.

I have to call a spade a spade at this point.

Eric Musco is a TERRIBLE Community Manager and is out of his depth.  Not just on the forums, but even in the Q&amp;A as well.  

Don't get me wrong - I am not calling him a terrible person, nor making this personal, but he is terrible at this job.

He is oversensitive and a walking hype machine when he does talk, to the point where he just doesn't even seem genuine.

And if nothing else, a good community manager needs to come off as genuine and have thick skin.

Anyone who has gamed long enough has seen both good and bad, and Eric is on the bad side.  He'd honestly be better off moving to some form of marketing for the game, as from what I have seen of his skill set on the forums, in the Anaheim Q&amp;A, and in person (I was at the Chicago/Rosemont Cantina Crawl a year back), he just is NOT equipped for the Community Manager role.

And that's nothing personal, but it just is my impression that the stress of a job that he isn't good at is weighing on him.  Things like this happen because he isn't involved in the community he is supposed to be managing, and he is condescending to the players.

Coming from SWG, we had our share of good and bad community managers, and I can tell you the best ones were the ones who were involved in the community.  You saw them posting on a daily or near daily basis.  It wasn't always with game information - sometimes it was just to be about the community, other times it was to promote fan sites and such, and still others, they would take questions to bring back to the devs, oft with the caveat of ""no promises"", but would usually come back with some form of answer 30-40% of the time.

When SWG shut down and I moved on to DDO while waiting for SWTOR to be released, I found that the Community Manager there was much in the same vein as the best of SWG.  Very similar in terms of being about the community, even if there was nothing to report.

By contrast, that is so not the vibe I have gotten from Eric.  I sense a guy who IS passionate about the game, but he comes off not genuine when talking to people, and gives the feel that he doesn't come around the players unless he HAS to.  Thus all his talk about how awesome the players are rings false to me.

Combine that with how clandestine SWTOR development is and poor management of the community by the aforementioned standards, and its not surprising to see things as they are.

That is NOT to say the people who crossed the line and personally harassed the developer were right to do so - FAR from it.  I am a HUGE advocate of ""developers are people too"".  Those nutjobs should be jailed.

However, that being said, sometimes the fringe incidents can be mitigated with better community management, not some reactionary fast-talking community manager threatening the greater player base with silence."

Because of their past history &amp; how SA dealt with the Houthis, they knew that if the Houthis succeed in their fight against Al-Qaida, they will be a threat to their south. SA already feels entrapped, they'd be damned if they'll have a state in enemy hands south of them."

"Male infant circumcision is endorsed by the Atlanta Center for Disease Control, and the American Medical Association's Academy of Pediatrics. According to these organizations of many 10s of thousands of Medical Doctors, all the latest scientific information about male infant circumcision is that it is very effective in reducing transmission of AIDS and other venereal diseases and protects women who have sex with circumcised men from nearly all cervical cancers. There is no scientific  evidence of reduced sexual enjoyment  and the rate of serious complication when performed in a hospital sterile  environment is extremely rare.


http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/male-circumcision-benefits-outweigh-risks-cdc-says/

https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/newborn-male-circumcision.aspx

More than 1 billion Muslim and Jewish males are circumcised and continue to support this minor surgical removal of a tiny piece of skin from their son's penises because they personally know for a fact there are no side effects on sexual function or enjoyment. 

On the other hand female genital mutilation is condemned as completely without any possible medical benefit by every medical organization in the world. The one and only purpose of this criminal act is to amputate the clitoris and thereby deprive the victim for life of sexual pleasure. The goal is to prevent the female victim from being interested in premarital sex so she will not be tempted to ruin the ""family honor"", a supposed crime in many primitive cultures that requires the male relatives to murder a transgressing female relative.

Of course here on Reddit, with its active fanatical nutcase community of complete kooky nut-bars opposed to infant male circumcision, no amount of scientific evidence matters to their obsession. 

**These crazy loons blame all their failures at life on Mamma and Dada hurting their pee-pee when they were a little baby.** Expect to see in response to my post a massive cut-and paste response full of crazy unscientific bullshit. They will stop at nothing, citing European  policies set 30 years ago as supposed rebuttals to the Atalanta CDC policy arrived at 2 months ago, they will claim secret conspiracies of Jews and Muslims and insurance companies are behind it all etc. etc. etc.

These crazy fanatics here on Reddit will do anything but accept reality, which is that infant male circumcision is, according to the latest scientific evidence, harmless to sexual enjoyment and has many healthy benefits against disease transmission, but female genital mutilation, i.e clitoris amputation, is a criminal assault intended for only one purpose, for the sick family in these backwards primitive cultures to oppress the female child by permanently robbing her for her whole life of sexual enjoyment, lest she commit an act of supposed ""family dishonor"" by having sex before marriage in which case they then think they have the right and duty to murder her.

As I say expect now a massive cut-and-paste response to my post from the fanatics full of lies and ancient 30 year old ""evidence against male infant circumscription"" and insane conspiracy claims about the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics.

"I am copying and pasting the response I told someone else.  
The whole premise of homosexuality being an evolutionary paradox is the case example of armchair scientists trying to grapple with science. Evolution is no where close to a perfecting event, it is a survival event. Whales still have hip bones, plants are largely green and not black, etc. The species that survive and reproduce are the ones that pass of their genes and not the dead ones. Note, there are two important parts, SURVIVE and REPRODUCE. So long as homosexuality provides an increase rate in overall survival, which allows for others to reproduce more, it will be selected for.  
  
Evolution is not about perfection. Very few living things have the greatest possible solution to a selective pressure they are experiencing, e.g. obtaining food. As you specialize to a single thing, you tend to trade this off by being worse at other things, e.g. hawks can fly very fast but only in short burst. Thus, to survival long enough to mate, a lot of different factors are at play with regards to creating shelter, preventing predation, obtaining food, etc. If homosexuals themselves did not reproduce, but increased all survival factors, there relatives would have a higher chance of reproducing. This is how homosexuality could be selected for, by being a trait that is expressed only sometimes in a population
  
Homosexuality is increasingly thought to be part of epigenetics. Meaning there is not a 'gay gene' or 'gay gene family.' Epigenetics is the control of the way that genes are read. This can be transfered from parents to offspring without either parent being homosexual. It can also explain why the rates of 'mutations' are so high because epigenetic mutation are much more common than DNA sequence level mutations."

"Should say ""Habitual Cheater"""
"&gt; The Human Genome Project found all humans to have a 99.9 % similar genetic content and identity, but this is **challenged by a new more detailed research suggesting a higher genetic diversity, with further medical and evolutionary implications.**

&gt; Previous studies focused on analyzing polymorphism (variation) in DNA nucleotidic bases. **But the new approach tackled deletions or duplications of code among relatively long sequences of individual DNA and then compared the so-called copy number variations (CNVs) across individuals from different human breeds. This method uncovered a complex, higher-order variation in the code and better explains why some populations or races are vulnerable to certain diseases and respond well to specific drugs, while counterparts swiftly fall sick or never respond to treatment.**

&gt; Two technical breakthroughs, a **faster, accurate sequencing of DNA and a powerful software programme to spot the CNVs allowed the new approach. 1,447 CNVs were located in roughly 2,900 genes, which means around 12 % of the human DNA.** ""Each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of DNA,"" said Matthew Hurles from Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. **""One of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our DNA varies in copy number. We estimate this to be at least 12 % of the genome.""**

&gt; **""The copy number variation that researchers had seen before was simply the tip of the iceberg, while the bulk lay submerged, undetected. We now appreciate the immense contribution of this phenomenon to genetic differences between individuals.""**

&gt; **Some missing or duplicated DNA fragments are very large, thus CNVs might have a big impact on gene expression. About 16 % of genes related to disease have been found to possess CNVs,** like those involved in the rare DiGeorge, Williams-Beuren and Prader-Willi syndromes or more common schizophrenia, cataracts, spinal muscular atrophy and atherosclerosis. **But kidney disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and vulnerability to malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which recent research has blamed on single-letter variations in the gene code, are also suspected for CNVs.** **""The stage is set for global studies to explore anew... the clinical significance of human variation,""** said Huntington Willard at Duke University in North Carolina.

&gt; **The new data also shows that our species is so recent that the vast majority of CNVs, around 89 %, was found to be shared among the 269 people belonging to Mongoloid Race (Japanese and Chinese), African Negroid (Yoruba Nigerians) and Caucasoid (of Northern and Western European ancestry). But there are also widespread specific differences in CNVs according to the race and even inside the same race according to population (geographical origin). This means that over 200,000 years or so, natural selection favored subtle variants allowing different humans populations to adapt to their different environments, with specific climate, pathogens, and food resources.**

"yes, trivial. and yes, it matters if it happens to a white person, but not every black person that gets killed by a white person is done so based on a racial bias either, so that's kind of besides the point.

and no, making judgements about people based on their race is not racist, because not all racial stereotyping is racist.  thinking that someone is not as 'good' as you or others are because of their race is racism, and rarely do you see that applied to white people. even if I were to accept that a more-than-trivial amount of people think all white people are racist, which they are, because most people (talking about in the US) are racist to some degree (and even more so within a demographic that has been historically considered to be a more superior race), I would say that it would be the exception because it is a racial stereotype (not racism by any meaningful definition) about people being racist."

However, I think there's a serious problem when your primary attempts to prevent botting revolve around placing restrictions on your game's features that punish legitimate players. Even worse that none of them actually work. DRM, anyone? These unfun anti-botting mechanisms are baked right into the fundamental design of the game and they still don't work. That's a death sentence.

I don't want to spout only doom and gloom. I'm definitely thankful that Neople's trying -- I love playing the game. I admire all the heart they're pouring into bringing this service back and it really get the feels going to think about the amount of stress these devs are putting themselves under. Sadly, the game's just far too vulnerable to hacks and botting, and they don't have near enough people to manually deal with it."
"Price controls cause shortages. This is commonly accepted by most economists. If a price is set for bread there will be shortages. If the price is to high there will be a shortage of consumers.

A positive is that those who do find work will be making more then they are worth. companies will move quickly to train them and turn them into a profitable investment. "

"There is a stigma against religious people too. Not for the majority of people who have a faith or occasionally/regularly attend church. Those people are in the majority and there is no real stigma against them. There is in some intellectual elite circles a belief amongst atheists that they've transcended the world of man made religions and those who haven't are dumber or wasting their potential - a bit of pity. 

But there is a strong cultural stigma against people who are devoutly religious. Those who talk about Jesus and God all the time no matter what. Those who only believe in faith healing. That kind of ""hill-billy"" Protestant that are stereotyped on TV and movies. 

So why do I bring it up? The most militant atheists I've met fell into either of those camps. Brilliant intellectual who can't understand how people can live their lives off of ""stories"" and then those that had extremely religious (stereotypical over the top Christianity) and have rejected it with as much zeal.

"I got a Gjallahorn in the VoG in like October, I also got my last raid gear that run too. Hit level 30 shortly after and didn't touch Destiny until about 2 weeks ago. That Gjallahorn had about 1/3 of it's upgrades and I had no idea what I'd stumbled on to.

Six months later, load up and get back into Destiny. Was playing Crota for the first time with some friends, and just getting up to speed. New raid, new patches, etc. I learned Gjallahorn is pretty much worshipped, the thing is very rare but man does it pack a punch.

I have half the hours of everyone in this group, and their entire Guardian's *life* at this point are solely to get Ghally, and it was fun sharing that I had one at that moment. I was the Gjallahorn hipster because I said it wasn't really that great (it wasn't upgraded enough for the burst rockets). I upgraded it and was impressed, and even had a new place in the group even though I was an ""outcast"" after almost 6 months without playing the game.

So I played for 2 weeks, a few jokes here and there to my friends about ""Why don't you just use Gjally? This is easy!"", all in good fun. The HoW comes out, fun times, we play PoE 28,  oooh giant chest for this key! Aaaaaaaaaand another Gjallahorn for Backfjre. I had many maniacal giggles as my party chat was lit up with anger and envy. It was kinda funny that I now had 2 within the past 20 hours of gameplay, while all these people had none with 2500 hours between all of them. 

Then I loaded up my next character, did the story, nabbed another key, run another PoE........... *another* Gjallahorn. Two in the same day.

Quite suddenly, this isn't very funny anymore and I turned into the bad guy (ignoring my earlier maniacal laughter). My Gjally jokes have slowed and now I just feel bad... hopefully my friends get a Gjally soon so that my name isn't spoken with scorn anymore. I'm very lucky, and I know it, and I hope Xur sells Gjally soon for those less fortunate than me."

"TERA's combat is second to none, but as you noticed, the story and general atmosphere are pretty crap.  Which just so happen to be two of FFXIV's biggest strengths.

If you're okay with the idea of paying a subscription and the combat of FFXIV doesn't turn you off (and I should add that like all MMOs the combat feels much better at 50), then I guess your primary question is ""is the subscription worth it"".  To which, in my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.  Square Enix are one of the few MMO developers in the last decade who have actually been putting out enough content to warrant the $15 a month price tag.  They deliver massive, well-made, polished patches every three months, each containing at least three dungeons, one raid, lots of new items and gear designs, several hours worth of quests that continue the world story beyond level 50, and often brand new game systems such as player/guild housing, a casino zone with minigames and Chocobo racing, a 24v24v24 PvP battleground, and even an entirely new class at one point.

So if you enjoy this style of game and are fine with traditional MMO combat, you really can't go wrong with FFXIV. If you're burnt out on tab-target combat, you might really enjoy TERA enough to overlook its flaws, because the combat really is spectacular.

You could even play both, since TERA is free.  I like TERA's combat enough to hop on every few months and play it casually when we're at the tail end of an FFXIV patch, but the glacial pace of content updates and the annoying cash shop just don't make it worth it for me to play it long term.  The cash shop might not be P2W, but I like being able to earn cosmetic items in-game rather than paying money for them, which I can do in FFXIV while also knowing that my $15 a month is going towards producing playable content on a reliable 3 month schedule.  FFXIV's cash shop is actually a bit of a joke, containing only a mount I never see anyone use, a couple minipets, some ugly metallic dye colors and past seasonal vanity items that can be obtained for free if you're playing when the event is running."

&gt; But, on his point that the state courts do not have to follow the lead of a federal trial or appeals court on any issue of law, the chief justice is quite right. 

[Georgetown Law Center](http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/legal-writing-scholarship/writing-center/upload/which_court_is_binding_painter-and-mayer-final.pdf)

&gt;  Similarly, state courts must sometimes decide issues of federal law, but they are not bound by federal courts except the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court, a federal court, is mandatory on state courts when it decides an issue of federal law, such as Constitutional interpretation. ***Other federal courts—district and appellate—are not mandatory on state courts.*** "

"Actually there was more to him dropping out then just the seeding. The bracket was already behind in all the games (Melee, Project M and Smash 4) and he has a very good chance of placing top 8 in each of them. So his opponents would have to wait for him to play his sets in 3 different games which would slow down the bracket a lot. So he dropped out of melee which is at the current time the game which he is least likely to place top 3 in and make money off of. Makes sense since smash is his job. "

"The sinner's prayer is unbiblical, praying ""God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"" is not.

Luke 18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 14 I tell you, **this man went down to his house justified** rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

(Bolding for emphasis is mine)

Jesus saved His people from their sins on the cross. (Heb 1:3, 9:12, 10:10-14) We lay hold on this justification by faith.  We stand totally justified before God because our righteousness is of Christ, not of ourselves. (2 Cor 5:21)   The evidence of genuine faith and regeneration is a fear of God (reverential awe), repentance, baptism, and good works.   We try to obey God because we are saved, not to try to get saved.

You could say that God's people were eternally saved before the foundation of the world when Christ engaged as a surety for His people. [2 Timothy 1:9 KJV]

In the eternal mind of God, Christ became a surety for His people, to pay their debts and make satisfaction for them. When one becomes a surety for another, the other is immediately freed, if the surety is accepted.  God knows the beginning from the end, and knows that His Son will pay off their debts, and therefore sees His people as righteous in Christ.  In the sense of active justification, God's people are justified in the mind of God from eternity.  In the sense of passive justification, God's people are justified in time when the coat of righteousness is put on by faith.

"That's pretty natural to ask. I mean it's a simple question of curiosity right? Not OP gaining information to stalk her or something right? "
"&gt;  I loathe the term ""milf"". It suggests an assumption that any woman who has had a child is somehow unfuckable/unattractive, except for the rare ""milf"" exception.

Kinda. Realistically, pregnancy takes its toll on a womans body and not all women do anything to keep in shape during pregnancy or work to get their attractive body back after its over. On top of that, after taking care of their kids, most mothers have a hard enough time keeping themselves awake and showered, let alone finding time to hit the gym and put on makeup. So quite a few tend to let themselves go and that is honestly, unattractive. 

Milfs are the ones who are organized and motivated enough to keep themselves in shape and clean. Frankly, they should be celebrated as more attractive and a goal for other mothers to emulate.

I'm not putting down mothers. Motherhood is one of the hardest, messiest, most time consuming, emotionally draining, unforgiving jobs out there. I'm just pointing out that it takes a physical toll that needs to be combated if a woman wants to be considered attractive. 

I'd also like to point out that this is not gender specific. The same thing happens to dads. That's why most dads are socks and sandals with a pot belly unattractive  and then women swoon over fathers with muscles. Those are the Dilfs.

I'm saying this as I'm about to leave for the gym, with my So who is a soon to be milf, for yoga and then lifting. I wand to be her dilf and she wants to be my milf. We both accept that doesn't happen without hard work and motivation. We also want to set that example for our soon to be hatched."

"I'm the same, except I notice I only have that attitude when it comes to Christians. I grew up in a neighborhood where devout Christians were pretty much non-existent. Most people were atheists or agnostic. There were also a few Muslims, but for some reason that just seemed to belong to their Turkish or Arabic background, so I never really judge them for their beliefs (except when they're being extreme, but I never met people like that yet). The first time I met devout Christians was in college. I was simply appalled that those people still exist! Most of them had pretty extreme views in my opinion, so I had a hard time taking them seriously. I also met some students who called themselves Christians and wore crucifixes and stuff, but they didn't even know what some of their holidays were about, so that seemed pretty dumb to me. So yeah, I can't help but automatically think someone is less smart when I find out they're Christians. However, what stood out most about Christian students to me was their significantly lower self esteem. They seem to have this tendency to loathe themselves, they don't really allow themselves to have a good time and they tend to have more unhealthy relationships (I've also seen more obsessive compulsive serial dating among them for some reason). So most of all I just really pity them. "

I guess the same is true for virtual particles. I don't know about them but i know about virtual work, which sounds like a very similar concept.


Both of those things may be used to describe real world problems, but they don't occur in the real world. There's no imaginary anything in the real world. Those concepts are often used in engineering and physics, because complex numbers can simplify differential equations a lot. So while those things do not exist in the real world, they do exist in math. But just because you can imagine numbers that are the result of sqrt(-1), and you can even use them to solve problems, doesn't mean they exist. 


If the solution to your equation is sqrt(-1) = i, you are pretty much fucked as an engineer there's no way you'll be able to buy a piece of wood that's i long. But if you used i to represent a second dimension that greatly simplified your equation you can just turn the piece of wood 90°."

"Ehh. In this specific case, I kinda have to agree with him (in theory - not that this case was censorship). Many people seem to confalte _freedom of expression_, which is explicitly freedom from state censorship, with censorship in general which isn't state exclusive.

And even when it comes to freedom of expression I kinda don't like the rhethoric that it's only state censorship that matters. I mean, we can see many examples of private entities with vast power limiting people's ability to say stuff in ways similar to that of repressive regimes - basically killing people that speak up. And of course we have plenty of fictional examples.

""State"" is after all a made up word that we apply quite arbitrarily without really a good definition other than ""those we think are states"". When you start using any more concrete definition - such as the one common in anarchist circles, ""An entity that with some success claims monopoly on violence over a sizable geographical area"", we have to consider whether to treat various large corporations that fit the bill as states when we discuss rights. Is it any different if Nestle threatens to kill farmers who speak up in west africa to if the west african states had done it instead?

Now, of course, being banned from twitter isn't at all comparable to various megacorporations' financing of murder squads, but in principle I don't think he's wrong (in that limiting censorship to government is outdated and pointless), and certainly not wrong enough to laugh at him for that. There's so much else to laugh at him over.

(Also, I do think that private companies' power over speech on the internet is a huuuge issue and certainly can be very heavy censorship and even be a threat to freedom of expression, but the danger there lies much more with Google than with something like Twitter."
"Yes why, clans are super gay.

"Near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dust-bowl corn fields of any mid-western alternate reality. The dad is played by Mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like SEVENTY through the corn without the slightest bump, all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone. 

After stealing the drone, Mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that NASA really did go to the Moon. He is chosen by Alfred to blast off with Catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3-stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space station/rocket-ship. After leaving Earth, they need no longer adhere to primitive Earth technology. Now they can do anything that already ever happened on Star Trek, including Cryo-Sleep.

When they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that Stanley and Alfred told them about. They are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to, at least that's Plan A. There is a Plan B but it's sub PC and is not going to work for Mud who is all about hurrying on up back to Earth so he can save everyone.

Gotta say more here about Mud's robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging HVAC ducts that can navigate through zero gravity, run across boulder fields, and even walk on water, not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying. 

After they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply. Each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on Earth. Where's Einstein when you need him? The whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since Catwoman can't swim.

Back on Earth, the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their old-school monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dust-bowl Arkansas. Mud's kids get growed up and environmentally challenged, but it's really about how Mud abandoned them. 

Eventually Mud and Catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dust-bowl earth, yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there, perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers. They find a sinister guy who looks like Matt Damon's dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up. Mud decides that he's gonna take the tin man and fly into the near-bye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away. 

Mudbot knows in his crazy-brilliant, hillbilly-sage way, that if he just makes a B-line through the B-hole he is going to pop the cherry. With Hans Zimmer in the house Mud trips his way through the five-dimensional space. After an abbreviated acid trip (Thanks Kubrick, thanks Trumbull) Mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library. He peers through the stacks at his past-life capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who can't even hear him. If only he could communicate using just his sheer acting....

Meanwhile, Mud's grown-up daughter on Earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to Argo F himself for not joining her in her cave. She doesn't like the air quality either so she torches her bro's corn crop. Harsh. Then she starts moping around in the old family library, the very same one that Mud is trapped behind the stacks in, except Muds library is made by humans from the future. At least that's what the robot said. Suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need is… …. wait for it…. Gravity!

Lots of good opportunities to cry here, what with Mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left. Something (no idea what) clicks and Mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the 'quantum data' into Morse code so that he can power-emote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on. Wait, did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? It did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravity-signal wiggles coming through the black-hole bookshelf world from her crazy hick-savant dad.

Well that about wraps it up. Needless to say,... big daughter trans-codes the Quantum Jiggles into FORTRAN code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to Hawaii again. 

Years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryo-naps in the hope of seeing Mud again. Darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples don't figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find Mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved. Apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to Saturn with her tube and her hospital Bed. A bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed. When Mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at Mud even though he is their great gran-pappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love.

More sweet, sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate. After an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth, steal a spaceship, and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robot.

"I don't intend to rock the boat by writing this letter, but I do need to let people know that Mr. Brad S Wilson   has been peddling blasphemy, obscenity, libel, and sedition for far too long. My hope is that the following text will delight the critical and offer food for thought to those contemplating Brad's virulent, slimy personal attacks. His representatives criticize others for being wayward but do absolutely nothing themselves to call a spade a spade. Although this discrepancy sincerely indicates that Brad's representatives are all sharp-tongued but soft-toothed hypocrites, Brad's grand plan is to substitute pap for art. I'm sure Mao Tse Tung would approve. In any case, Brad's positions are not an abstract problem. They have very concrete, immediate, and unpleasant consequences. For instance, if Brad succeeds in his attempt to teach fastidious concepts to children, it'll have to be over my dead body. We must give parents the means to protect their children. We must name and shame Mr. Brad S Wilson  's fans for their prolix acts of oligarchism. And we must light the torch of human rights.

"The league of american bicyclists argument is an [appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority), I want to discuss *why*.

Being predictable is a good idea. I think ideally rules or laws specifically for bicycles would be well known and understood by both cyclists and drivers so everyone can act predictably. I totally agree about not riding on sidewalks, etc. I'm not saying it should be anarchy, just that they shouldn't have to follow the same rules as cars.

&gt; For example, on streets without bike lanes and with insufficient passing room, the law allows bicyclists to take the entire lane of traffic, just like any other vehicle

This is actually a good example of when they did a good job appending the law. I totally agree with this law existing, by my POV for this post is specifically in cities, where cars are going to be in stop-and-go red-light traffic. I totally will take up the whole lane in faster moving traffic if I need to for safety, but if cars are all stopped at a red light constantly, I want to be able to lane split and pass them. Cycling downtown is actually faster than driving in traffic, and I want to be able to take advantage of that, legally (I'm pretty sure lane splitting is actual legal where I am because motorcycles can do it, but thats besides the point).

&gt; Finally, the best solution for the problems you identify is not to introduce separate rules for bicyclists, but rather is to beef up bicycle-specific infrastructure

Totally agree, and I'm glad to see that happening more and more, and I hope the trend continues."

"Ignoring the fact that you have no understanding of how the current flawed justice system works that actively works to prevent cops from arresting/firing/charging other cops with crimes.

All cops are not one big barrel, they're a bunch of little (though some are pretty big still, NYC, LA, Washington DC) barrels spread out across the country. A average cop in Florida is not likely to have anything to do with a average cop in New York. 

We can shrink that distance. A average cop in New York City, is not likely to have anything to do with a average cop in Buffalo. 

Hell I mean technically it's possible that in New York City, two or more cops may never encounter eachother. They have an active 34,000 officers, that's a lot of people. 

Do you actually think that 800 thousand police officers across 12,000 different departments are all interconnected? Because that just sounds ridiculous no matter how you spin it.

"What Mulcair says is simply untrue.  First, since the gov't dumped the long gun registry, the murder rate has dropped.  Secondly, the Ruger Mini 14 has always been unrestricted, Bill C-42 will not make it easier to get, in fact Bill C-42 makes it more difficult to get a firearms license, and will therefore make any long gun, including the Mini 14, more difficult to get.  And thirdly, as a non-restricted firearm, the Mini 14 is in no way affected by the transport provisions of C-42.

"Ah the great Leprechaun Massacre of 1534.

&gt;Leprch Island was used as a sanctuary for its inhabitants, known as ""Leprechauns"" because of its natural defences and rocky shores and safety from mainland Ireland; which at the time was actively hunting them down, in earlier times it was almost impossible to land there. The Leprechauns had been driven off the mainland in the Irish Uprising of 1524, and took to the island as a last hope. It was also respected as a hiding place, as it was the one-time abode of Paddy O'Patrick, one of the oldest known Leprechauns. Installing themselves in the castle built in the 14th century by the Irish King Seamus the Toole the Leprechauns made Leprch their base for resistance to the Mainland Irish people. Sniffles Greentoes and other Leprechaun leaders also thought it prudent to send their wives, children, aged and sick to the Island for safety.

&gt;Acting on the instructions of Lord Rónán Mac Giolla Eoin and the Earl of Tipperary, Cathal Ó Loingsigh and Sir John Norreys of England took the castle by storm. Loingsigh used two cannons to batter the castle and when the walls gave through, Eoin ordered direct attack on 25 July. The Captain, Lucky Greenknickers was killed and Constable of the garrison surrendered. Eoin was very tough in settling the terms of surrender. The Constable, his family and one of the hostages were given safe passage to America and all other defending soldiers were killed. The next morning, on 26th, Eoin's forces started hunting others who were hiding in the nearby caves. Despite the castle's surrender, they killed all the 800 defenders, as well as more than 4000 civilian men, women and children. The people killed were families of followers of Sniffles Greentoes. Loingsigh was also charged with the task of preventing any escape vessels leaving the Island. The entire family of Sniffles Greentoes perished in the massacre. Eoin, who ordered the killings, boasted in a letter to Seamus O'Fanny, the Irish general secretary and spymaster, that Sniffles watched the massacre from his escape vessel helplessly and was ""likely to run mad from sorrow"".

"Mental health is actually pretty even across the board. Different disorders and diagnoses are more prevalent in different social groups (no shit right?) but the overall rates of mental health concerns really aren't correlated to social standing at all. It genuinely is a pretty powerful equalizer.

Even beyond that men are less likely to seek treatment for mental health concerns because of the stigmatization of ""just be a man and deal with it"" on top of the already existing stigmatization of mental health.

&gt;I can't think of a single issue specific to/disproportionately affecting white straight men that I feel remotely sympathetic toward.

Do you mean that in the sense that you will personally devote your time and attention to other more pressing and/or other issues closer to you, or do you mean that if a white heterosexual male friend of yours was experiencing one of these problems you would have no sympathy for them? One of those things is fine and I even encourage it to some extent. The other is incredibly questionable."

Yes they can. Everyday unions can demand protection from firing. That can be put into an employment contract. This is all perfectly legal stuff. 

&gt;This is entire argument being made for police as well; that police unions should exist to protect their members rights to work in a fair and equal environment, not to have special exemptions when breaking the law.

There's no special exemption. This man's employer violated their employment contract, and was forced to make restitution. "

To label him a murderer, which is the unlawful killing of another human being, when the courts have made it plain that legally that wasn't the case is illogical and is based on emotions and not facts.        
Secondly, Zimmerman has had a lot of problems from this, as I said before, not all consequences of such choices are immediate death or jail,  and it appears he is being treated for ptsd from the incident. He may drink himself to death or commit suicide, or perhaps run afoul of the law over something badly enough to go to jail if treatment fails and he cannot come to grips with it, but that willl just be another sad part of this overall tragedy and not something to be celebrated.

"I am almost positive you didn't read my post now. Please read it, I address this exact issue in it. 

Ill restate what is already in my post, cities don't have populations like a real city so that can't even be compared. There are millions of people in cities in real life and maybe 2-5 people on at each city around civcraft at one time. This means that more people have to be combat ready especially since the people attacking you will be.

Your comment keeps comparing Civcraft to real life when the server is hardly like real life *at all*. I think you may have forgotten Civcraft is just another game and it's meant to be played for fun and an escape from the real world to do unrealistic things. Most of the points you make like: 

&gt;In reality, not even the majority of the people in the military are fighting units. Real life militaries REQUIRE a huge proportion of the population to be non-combatants, in order to support those fighters. versus Pvp here which requires basically zero of the population to support the fighters. Or maybe like one guy. And so there's no civilization really needed -- you are sort of just the sum of your parts power wise, there's no synergy and minimum cooperative organization required (basically just show up to a vault when needed and do a mediocre job of unit fighting), thus no laws, no government truly needed, etc.

Are extremely cringe because your acting as if the military in real life can even be closely compared to a minecraft servers military. Im not sure if you are trolling but you have very uneducated thoughts throughout this comment about PvP and Civcraft as a server and are probably not the best person not be arguing this.

This whole comment is just a long way to say people don't want to put time into learning an aspect of a game their playing btw."
"Hi Bicyclists..  some quick notes.

I will not stop for you at a crosswalk when you're on your bike.

I also think you jumping off your bike at a crosswalk is a cheap and shitty move when you stop 47 cars for your 1 bike.  You're technically following the law, so I stop, but fuck you because it's a dick move.  Fuck you.

Don't ride on main streets when there are ample back streets that are much more safe for you, and much more safe from you potentially fucking me up with your in and out and sideways dick moves with zero notice for a 1000 plus pound vehicle that would have to stop on a dime to accommodate you.  It's like when cars pull in front of semi's and stop.  I don't think you realize that it's slower for a car to stop than you on your dick bike.

You need to fully stop and wait your turn at 4 way stops FYI, as OP noted.

Get some fucking bike lights.. signals if you're going to pretend to be a car.  I don't understand how you can get away with being a car, and also a pedestrian at crossings, and not have to have basic signal gear.

"&gt;You still missed the point, though. They were reporting behavior that was normal for Muslims post-Muhammad. It's simple, really. You just seem too dense to grasp it. Doesn't matter if they lied or whatnot, the behavior was normal i.e. sex slaves and rape. 

Yeah, but if it contradicts the Qu'ran then it was reformed by Islam, 2hard2understand.

&gt;Islam didn't reform that, it continued and Muslims partook in it. You seem delusional and think Muhammad and the Sahaba didn't do it, but they did. They were warlords. 

How many slaves Muhammad took? How many slaves he liberated? How many slaves he had at his death?

&gt;They have better qualifications for studying it than you do, to begin with they can actually read Arabic. 

Muslim apologist excuse, then you deny all english sites about Islam? Making you backpedal hard boy.

&gt;Also, canonizing Hadith doesn't mean you're saying you have authority over the Quran. 

When you're giving precedence to hadiths over the Qu'ran it does, it's specific but you're too dense to get it so I'll keep making fun at you and documenting your utter failure to provide a decent argument.

&gt;Doesn't matter, scholars still studied the Hadith and had 1400 years of various times of peace and war to study them - including the freest the middle east has ever been during the golden age.

&gt;Also, KSA isn't the only place with scholars. But of course you have your fail safe card here - non-Arab scholars don't matter according to you as Arab scholars word is superior for some reason you still can't explain. 

I'm saying that it's irrelevant if some random Imam says something in France because he lacks authority. Meanwhile a lot of people act based on Saudi clerics. I'm not saying it's right, I'm stating the facts.

&gt;Yes, yes, very convenient. Allows you to disregard non-Saudi scholars. 

Do you deny it? Why are you so mad? :-)

&gt;Such progressive society! Golden age caliphs killing lawmakers over fantasy novels...truly Islam at its height!

Yeah, it took 2 centuries for them to reform the jurisprudence and it ruined Islam. Scholars got their revenge by moving the authority from the Caliph to the scholars tho.

&gt;You are stating propaganda. Who actually falls for the Saudi scholars being special thing nowadays? lol. 

Yeah you're right, their version of salafism isn't popular at all, especially not to the youth. Oh wait.

&gt;I was talking about slavery, did I mention rape you illiterate monkey? lmao. 

Didn't you mention that with POW hadith?

&gt;I did already, saying the shahada and believing it makes you a Muslim. Anything else makes a you a bad Muslim. 

Where do you get your shahada from? Who told you that? What about the Qu'ran? You're not proving me wrong, we still need a word for people that don't follow the Qu'ran.

&gt;""Jihad has nothing to do with Islam""

""Your definition of Jihad has nothing to do with Islam"" FTFY

&gt;Clearly for you it is, since rape wasn't even mentioned but you obsess over it. Desperate for a straw man are you? lmao. 

Are you 100% sure that you didn't mention a hadith allegedly condoning rape?

&gt;Yes, thats cool. There's lots of insane Hadith.

&gt;Doesn't change the fact that Hadith started in order for people to understand the Quran better.

&gt;How are you a Muslim seriously, you don't even know basic shit about this religion. This is embarrassing as hell for you.

No, it's used to excuse the actions of some Caliphs centuries after the death of the Prophet. Islam existed and was functional without the hadiths for centuries as I already said. Who told you that you need those hadiths? The people who forged them!

&gt;Didn't I just ask you that? Tafseer exist to help understand the Quran. Why is that? Because the Quran is not clear, lol.

&gt;Such simple logic that you have trouble grasping, such is the diseased mind of a Muslim. 

Answer the question : Remind me again, when tafseer started and why? The Qu'ran is extremely explicit and clear (to the number of lashes you get) and doesn't need interpretation.

&gt;How does this even BEGIN to support what you're saying? Clearly you have trouble understanding english and now I have to fucking explain it slowly to you (not that it'll help).

&gt;This first quote, has nothing to do with Hadith so it's irrelevant and you probably put it there because you're not thinking straight.

You're clearly saying that I brush negative stuff, when I already showed that I don't value your opinion and what you consider negative, you backpedal.

&gt;Keyword: probably, because I don't know your position and you might be in denial about it like with the Aisha Hadith.

""probably, I was just pretending dude!!!"" Absolutely hilarious.

&gt;Yep, hence why I call you a schizo. You fip flop on slavery. But as we saw earlier, it was mostly likely an honest mistake borne of your poor reading comprehension. 

Feel free to quote my ""flip flopping"" then, and my alleged poor reading comprehension. Don't make a mistake again.

So answer me, do I deny negative stuff about Islam or not? Which one is it?

&gt;Do you enjoy talking to mentally challenged people? Is it a past time of yours? 

You're right I should stop replying, I have enough discrepancies coming from you but at the same time I feel bad for you.

&gt;Wrong, 

People don't rule based on translations, they are just here to give non-Arab speakers an idea. Comparing translated hadiths and translated Qu'ran is fine, but making rules out of any of them isn't.

Is your logic okay?

&gt;Oh god 

Why would you call me dumb when I'm correcting your mistakes? PS: You're not allowed to use ""oh god"", use something edgier.

&gt;Glad to see you don't deny it. 

Why would I give you any information about me, I didn't deny the kiddo accusations till I wanted to. It's funnier to read armchair psychology and it keeps you moving goal posts and making petty comments from baseless assumptions which I then ridicule.

&gt;But haven't proved me wrong on anything. You were wrong about Hadith, you flip flop on slavery, you're wrong about GCC states being successful and functional societies and only judge them based on crime stats....you've said so much stupid stuff it's overwhelming. 

- Hadiths don't have precedence over the Qu'ran in Islam

- If you read about the formation of the Islamic jurisprudence you can see that hadiths were forged under duress

- Arab Gulf has functional countries based on their human development index, crime rate and economy despite being new countries next to a never ending warzone.

Yeah no.

&gt;What's that? 

Yeah would be a shame if I couldn't you backpedal. You said ""Nope, I'm telling you that you're a nobody and your attempts at Hadith criticism can't even get past me, let alone a real scholar of Islam. "" and now you cannot refute my position.

&gt;Lmfao, 

It is on topic, answer can scholars be wrong? Are they perfect?

&gt;Post them then. 

""And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way"" (Qu'ran 17: 32).

""If any of you who do not have the means to marry free women who are believing, you may marry believing girls from whom your right hands possess. Allah knows best about your faith; you are all same in that respect. Marry them with the approval of their families and give them their gifts (dowries) correctly and courteously as married women, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. When they are married, if they commit adultery they should receive half the punishment  of (ordinary) chaste women. This is for those of you who are afraid of falling into sin. But being patient is better for you. Allah is Ever-forgiving, Most Merciful."" (Qur'an 4:25)

"&gt; ""The European Parliament shall, jointly with the Council, exercise legislative and budgetary functions. It shall exercise functions of political control and consultation as laid down in the Treaties. It shall elect the President of the Commission.""

Of course, what am I saying? What I meant to say was that the largest grouping's candidate is usually elected as Commission president.

&gt; In what world does an overwhelming majority of the votes going to the EPP, S&amp;D and ALDE groups' parties mean they don't have a mandate from the electorate?!

I'm talking about a mandate from the British electorate, who voted mainly for the EFDD and ECR.

&gt; I didn't realise that Baroness Anelay, Lord Maude, Baroness Neville-Rolfe, Earl Howe, Baroness Verma, Lord Freud, Baroness Altmann or Baroness Stowell had been elected by anybody

We're talking 2 out of 30 members of that Cabinet haven't a vote cast in their name. That's 94% that have, whereas 0% of the ECom have. Only a tiny proportion of the entire UK executive is unelected.


&gt; Yes, you said this before, and I re-stated that in the comment you're replying to

Apologies, it's late and I've been revising all day and heads a bit frazzled.

I personally think the only people that have a mandate over us are the people that we have directly elected through the ballot box. Even if the Commission was made of up elected MEP's I still wouldn't see that as a mandate because it would be made of up of people that the British people did not vote for."

Maybe, just maybe the nfl may have chosen the wrong person to to down this path with. Because in try to shame and incriminate brady, you are destroying your sport and one of its' greatest players' history. But its Roger Goddell's nfl where the media and league office are more concerned with deflated footballs than peds, concussions, domestic violence etc so its not too shocking. "

"When this was posted to either /r/Linux or /Linux_gaming, it was pointed out that as it stands, a lot of us haven't gotten the survey since using Linux. As someone who has a Lenovo gaming laptop running Windows and a desktop PC I built from scratch running Linux, I have always seen the surveys under my laptop and never on my desktop. I game a lot more on the desktop than the laptop, which is what makes it really odd to me. 

So it might be that the numbers are being skewed a little, though I won't say deliberately. Just seems odd they don't survey you under Linux as much, if at all... 

On a side note, the only games I play exclusively for Windows is the Five Nights At Freddie's series. So to me, Linux pretty much has replaced my OS of choice for gaming for a while now.

"Let me break it down.  I joined because I wanted to get school paid for and also get paid to go (Tuition Assistance and GI Bill). Last year, whoever the fuck heads are in charge of that decided that you can either get your school paid for, or a monthly stipend to live off of (which in my particular case isn't a whole lot) but not the two together. So I get 563 dollars a month right now to go to a school that I'm paying out of pocket for. Now this is not the case for everyone, there are different types of aid the military offers depending on how long you served for and how many combat deployments you've had. I'm pretty new to the military and working my way up with civilian classes. 

Secondly the VA is a terrible mess of red tape and hurdles you have to go through. It takes months just to be seen because they are so backed up. If the military breaks you, they should HAVE to fix you. Which I know a lot of guys who had small injuries, that were never documented, that ended up getting very bad when they're out. The VA is a good program, but needs work. 

Edit: The reason why the school thing is so frustrating is that I know people who get their education paid for by their parents, or are in debt a good majority of their life. I know people who got their school paid for because they are ""minorities"" or they grew up in a different area than I did. We work our asses off and give the military everything, our lives if need be to save our fellow brothers. And this is the payment we get... broken promises, cutbacks, and at any given time they can say ""we don't need you anymore"". It's just frustrating, and honestly the pay is terrible. But I must be a masochist, because I still love it.."
